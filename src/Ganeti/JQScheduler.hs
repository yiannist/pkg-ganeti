{-| Representation of the job queue

We keep two lists of jobs (together with information about the last
fstat result observed): the jobs that are enqueued, but not yet handed
over for execution, and the jobs already handed over for execution. They
are kept together in a single IORef, so that we can atomically update
both, in particular when scheduling jobs to be handed over for execution.
