Description: Abort ganeti-VER removal?
 You are attempting to remove ganeti-VER, but it seems that the running
 Ganeti version is still VER.
 .
 This can happen if you upgrade the Ganeti package to a new minor version, but
 have not run `gnt-cluster upgrade' yet. Removing the package will cause Ganeti to
 stop functioning correctly.
 .
 It is highly recommended to abort removal now and upgrade your cluster before
 removing ganeti-VER.
