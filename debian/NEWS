ganeti2 (2.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrading from the 'ganeti' package (versions 1.2.x) requires manual
    intervention; the proper procedure is available at
    http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/wiki/UpgradeNotes and requires full
    cluster shutdown. It is recommended to read that first before
    installing this package.
