ganeti2 (2.7.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Since 2.7.0-2, all internal Ganeti Python libraries are shipped as a private
  module. This is done because the Ganeti internal APIs are not guaranteed to
  be stable and direct use by 3rd-party applications is discouraged. Thus, any
  3rd-party programs importing Ganeti's Python code, should now live under
  /usr/share/ganeti2 or include /usr/share/ganeti2 in Python's sys.path.

  The RAPI client library, being the only stable external API, is now shipped
  as a public module in its own package, python-ganeti-rapi.

  Since 2.7.0-2, the HTML documentation is provided in the ganeti2-doc package.

ganeti2 (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upgrading from Lenny's 1.2 directly to 2.1 requires a two-step method: first
  run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade12 followed by the normal
  /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade. This is somewhat more tricky than the
  intermediate step (1.2 to 2.0 and 2.0 to 2.1), but should otherwise work.
  Backup of the configuration directory is of course recommended, and reading
  the wiki page too. Note: if running 2.0, it is possible do to the upgrade
  without downtime. If running 1.2, it is a must to stop instances.

  Detailed instructions (for both 1.2->2.1 and 2.0->2.1 upgrades):

  - stop cron, or comment out the watcher entry in cron
  - stop ganeti on the master node
  - make a backup of /var/lib/ganeti
  - install new software
  - if running 1.2, stop all instances
  - if running 1.2, first migrate all instances to DRBD8 using
    /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/drbd8-upgrade
  - if running 1.2, on the master node run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade12
  - on the master node, run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade
  - if both cfgupgrade runs have finished successfully, remove the file
    /var/lib/ganeti/ssconf_hypervisor on all nodes on which it still exists
  - on all non-master nodes, restart ganeti (invoke-rc.d ganeti restart); this
    will give some warnings for rapi and confd daemons, but ignore them for now
  - on the master node, restart ganeti, and confirm "gnt-node list" works
  - on the master node, run "gnt-cluster redist-conf"
  - restart ganeti on all nodes now (once more, and on the master node last)
  - check that "gnt-cluster verify" doesn't complain
  - you can now start all instances (if you stopped them)
  - you can now restart cron (or re-enable the watcher entry)

ganeti2 (2.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upgrading from the 'ganeti' package (versions 1.2.x) requires manual
  intervention; the proper procedure is available at
  http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/wiki/UpgradeNotes and requires full
  cluster shutdown. It is recommended to read that first before
  installing this package.
