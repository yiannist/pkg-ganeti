ganeti2 (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upgrading from Lenny's 1.2 directly to 2.1 requires a two-step method:
  first run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade12 followed by the normal
  /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade. This is somewhat more tricky than
  the intermediate step (1.2 to 2.0 and 2.0 to 2.1), but should
  otherwise work. Backup of the configuration directory is of course
  recommended, and reading the wiki page too.

ganeti2 (2.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upgrading from the 'ganeti' package (versions 1.2.x) requires manual
  intervention; the proper procedure is available at
  http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/wiki/UpgradeNotes and requires full
  cluster shutdown. It is recommended to read that first before
  installing this package.
