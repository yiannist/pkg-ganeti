ganeti (2.10.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Ganeti now ships a molly-guard(8) script that attempts to prevent an
  accidental shutdown or reboot of a node with running instances. To use this
  functionality, simply install the molly-guard package.

ganeti (2.10.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  As of 2.10.1-1, ganeti-htools is intended for stand-alone installation on
  non-cluster systems only and conflicts with the ganeti package. The ganeti
  package itself now provides the htools binaries for cluster systems in a way
  that is compatible with upstream's new upgrade model[1].

  Future minor version upgrades (e.g. from 2.10 to 2.11) will be compatible
  with upstream's new upgrade model, using `gnt-cluster upgrade' (see [1]).

ganeti (2.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of 2.8.0-1, ganeti is configured to use separate users for its daemons.
  Each daemon now runs as a different user (all with a “gnt-” username prefix)
  and root access is currently granted only to the node daemon. This is a
  build-time setting and existing installations will be automatically converted
  to use the new user separation model.

ganeti (2.7.0-2) unstable; urgency=low
  The ganeti2 package has been renamed to ganeti, since the original reasons
  for nameing the package ganeti2 (i.e. the 1.2 to 2.0 migration) no longer
  apply. A dummy transitional ganeti2 package is provided for compatibility,
  you can safely remove it after the installation has finished.

  Since 2.7.0-2, all internal Ganeti Python libraries are shipped as a private
  module. This is done because the Ganeti internal APIs are not guaranteed to
  be stable and direct use by 3rd-party applications is discouraged. Thus, any
  3rd-party programs importing Ganeti's Python code, should now live under
  /usr/share/ganeti or include /usr/share/ganeti in Python's sys.path.

  The RAPI client library, being the only stable external API, is now shipped
  as a public module in its own package, python-ganeti-rapi.

  Since 2.7.0-2, the HTML documentation is provided in the ganeti-doc package.

ganeti2 (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upgrading from Lenny's 1.2 directly to 2.1 requires a two-step method: first
  run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade12 followed by the normal
  /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade. This is somewhat more tricky than the
  intermediate step (1.2 to 2.0 and 2.0 to 2.1), but should otherwise work.
  Backup of the configuration directory is of course recommended, and reading
  the wiki page too. Note: if running 2.0, it is possible do to the upgrade
  without downtime. If running 1.2, it is a must to stop instances.

  Detailed instructions (for both 1.2->2.1 and 2.0->2.1 upgrades):

  - stop cron, or comment out the watcher entry in cron
  - stop ganeti on the master node
  - make a backup of /var/lib/ganeti
  - install new software
  - if running 1.2, stop all instances
  - if running 1.2, first migrate all instances to DRBD8 using
    /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/drbd8-upgrade
  - if running 1.2, on the master node run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade12
  - on the master node, run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade
  - if both cfgupgrade runs have finished successfully, remove the file
    /var/lib/ganeti/ssconf_hypervisor on all nodes on which it still exists
  - on all non-master nodes, restart ganeti (invoke-rc.d ganeti restart); this
    will give some warnings for rapi and confd daemons, but ignore them for now
  - on the master node, restart ganeti, and confirm "gnt-node list" works
  - on the master node, run "gnt-cluster redist-conf"
  - restart ganeti on all nodes now (once more, and on the master node last)
  - check that "gnt-cluster verify" doesn't complain
  - you can now start all instances (if you stopped them)
  - you can now restart cron (or re-enable the watcher entry)

ganeti2 (2.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upgrading from the 'ganeti' package (versions 1.2.x) requires manual
  intervention; the proper procedure is available at
  http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/wiki/UpgradeNotes and requires full
  cluster shutdown. It is recommended to read that first before
  installing this package.
