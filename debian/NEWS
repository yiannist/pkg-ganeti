ganeti (2.11.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  Security Release.

  Please read the text of the advisory, quoted below, for more information:

  Ganeti, an open source virtualisation manager, suffered from an insecure file
  permission vulnerability that leads to sensitive information disclosure. This
  issue was fixed with versions 2.10.7 and 2.11.5.

  The Ganeti upgrade command ‘gnt-cluster upgrade’ creates an archive of the
  current configuration of the cluster (e.g. the contents of “/var/lib/ganeti”).
  The archive is named following the pattern ganet*.tar and is written to
  “/var/lib/”. Such archives were written with too lax permissions that made
  it possible to read them as unprivileged user, on the master node.

  The configuration archive contains sensitive information, including SSL keys
  for the inter-node communication via RPC as well as the credentials for the
  remote API (RAPI). Such information can be used to control various operations
  of the cluster, including shutting down and removing instances and nodes from
  the cluster, or assuming the identity of the cluster in a MITM attack.

  This vulnerability only affects Ganeti clusters meeting the following
  criteria:
   * The cluster is running Ganeti version 2.10.0 or higher.
   * The upgrade command was run, for example when upgrading from 2.10 to 2.11.
   * Unprivileged users have access to the host machines and in particular to
     the cluster master node.

  With the fixed release, the upgrade command will set the permissions of the
  archives properly. However, in case previous versions have created an unsafe
  archive already, the following mitigations are advised:
   * Remove the access to the archive for unprivileged users (for example by
     running “chmod 400 /var/lib/ganeti*.tar”).
   * Renew the SSL keys by running “gnt-cluster renew-crypto”. You may need to
     pass the --new-cluster-certificate, --new-confd-hmac-key,
     --new-rapi-certificate, --new-spice-certificate,
     --new-cluster-domain-secret flags, and (for version 2.11 only)
     the --new-node-certificates flag.
   * Renew the RAPI credentials by editing the /var/lib/ganeti/rapi_users file.
   * Update RAPI, confd and other clients with the new secrets and
     certificates, if applicable.
   * Look for any other information regarded as secret in /var/lib/ganeti and
     change it. For example VNC and SPICE passwords are not by default kept
     there, but could, if Ganeti is so configured.

  This vulnerability will be published as oCert-2014-006 on ocert.org; CVE ID is
  pending. Thanks to Apollon Oikonomopoulos for reporting and fixing this issue.

  Affected versions: 2.10.0 - 2.10.6, 2.11.0 - 2.11.4
  Fixed versions: 2.10.7, 2.11.5

ganeti (2.11.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Ganeti versions 2.10 and onwards support a coordinated cluster-wide
  upgrade between different minor versions (e.g. 2.10.5 -> 2.11.2). This makes
  the upgrade process different, depending on the previously installed
  version:

  * If you are upgrading from 2.10.x, you should first upgrade the packages on
    all cluster nodes and then run

      gnt-cluster upgrade --to=2.11

    on the master node to switch to the new version. The old 2.10 packages can
    be safely removed after a successful upgrade.

  * If you are upgrading from 2.9.x or earlier, please follow the usual
    upgrade procedure by stopping the master, upgrading the packages on all
    nodes (the master daemon will refuse to start), and then running
    cfgupgrade on the master node to upgrade the configuration.

ganeti (2.10.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Ganeti now ships a molly-guard(8) script that attempts to prevent an
  accidental shutdown or reboot of a node with running instances. To use this
  functionality, simply install the molly-guard package.

ganeti (2.10.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  As of 2.10.1-1, ganeti-htools is intended for stand-alone installation on
  non-cluster systems only and conflicts with the ganeti package. The ganeti
  package itself now provides the htools binaries for cluster systems in a way
  that is compatible with upstream's new upgrade model[1].

  Future minor version upgrades (e.g. from 2.10 to 2.11) will be compatible
  with upstream's new upgrade model, using `gnt-cluster upgrade' (see [1]).

ganeti (2.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of 2.8.0-1, ganeti is configured to use separate users for its daemons.
  Each daemon now runs as a different user (all with a “gnt-” username prefix)
  and root access is currently granted only to the node daemon. This is a
  build-time setting and existing installations will be automatically converted
  to use the new user separation model.

ganeti (2.7.0-2) unstable; urgency=low
  The ganeti2 package has been renamed to ganeti, since the original reasons
  for nameing the package ganeti2 (i.e. the 1.2 to 2.0 migration) no longer
  apply. A dummy transitional ganeti2 package is provided for compatibility,
  you can safely remove it after the installation has finished.

  Since 2.7.0-2, all internal Ganeti Python libraries are shipped as a private
  module. This is done because the Ganeti internal APIs are not guaranteed to
  be stable and direct use by 3rd-party applications is discouraged. Thus, any
  3rd-party programs importing Ganeti's Python code, should now live under
  /usr/share/ganeti or include /usr/share/ganeti in Python's sys.path.

  The RAPI client library, being the only stable external API, is now shipped
  as a public module in its own package, python-ganeti-rapi.

  Since 2.7.0-2, the HTML documentation is provided in the ganeti-doc package.

ganeti2 (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upgrading from Lenny's 1.2 directly to 2.1 requires a two-step method: first
  run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade12 followed by the normal
  /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade. This is somewhat more tricky than the
  intermediate step (1.2 to 2.0 and 2.0 to 2.1), but should otherwise work.
  Backup of the configuration directory is of course recommended, and reading
  the wiki page too. Note: if running 2.0, it is possible do to the upgrade
  without downtime. If running 1.2, it is a must to stop instances.

  Detailed instructions (for both 1.2->2.1 and 2.0->2.1 upgrades):

  - stop cron, or comment out the watcher entry in cron
  - stop ganeti on the master node
  - make a backup of /var/lib/ganeti
  - install new software
  - if running 1.2, stop all instances
  - if running 1.2, first migrate all instances to DRBD8 using
    /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/drbd8-upgrade
  - if running 1.2, on the master node run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade12
  - on the master node, run /usr/lib/ganeti/tools/cfgupgrade
  - if both cfgupgrade runs have finished successfully, remove the file
    /var/lib/ganeti/ssconf_hypervisor on all nodes on which it still exists
  - on all non-master nodes, restart ganeti (invoke-rc.d ganeti restart); this
    will give some warnings for rapi and confd daemons, but ignore them for now
  - on the master node, restart ganeti, and confirm "gnt-node list" works
  - on the master node, run "gnt-cluster redist-conf"
  - restart ganeti on all nodes now (once more, and on the master node last)
  - check that "gnt-cluster verify" doesn't complain
  - you can now start all instances (if you stopped them)
  - you can now restart cron (or re-enable the watcher entry)

ganeti2 (2.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upgrading from the 'ganeti' package (versions 1.2.x) requires manual
  intervention; the proper procedure is available at
  http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/wiki/UpgradeNotes and requires full
  cluster shutdown. It is recommended to read that first before
  installing this package.
