ganeti (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Iustin Pop ]
  * Packaged ganeti 2.0 and switched the binary package name to ganeti2
  * Renamed package to ganeti2, since migration from ganeti 1.2.x to 2.0.x
    is not automatic (and needs cluster shutdown)
  * Remove Leonardo (l@lmello.eu.org) from the Uploaders list, since he
    wasn't active in a long while
  * Fix "ganeti (HVM mode) default expected kernel:
    /usr/lib/xen/boot/hvmloader in lenny not exist" (Closes: #528618);
    note that this is a fix that works for unstable, not Lenny
