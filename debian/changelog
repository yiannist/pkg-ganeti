ganeti (1.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Move mdadm from depends to recommends: it's only useful with drbd0.7
  * Actually install example cron job as /etc/cron.d/ganeti
    The example cron job was copied to the wrong place and thus ignored.
  * Urgency medium because it was important for the cronjob to be there.
