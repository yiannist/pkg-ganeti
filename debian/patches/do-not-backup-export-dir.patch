    Do not backup exported instance data on upgrade

    gnt-cluster upgrade creates a configuration backup by tar'ing
    /var/lib/ganeti. Unfortunately, this means that exported instance data
    is also backed up during upgrade, which is clearly unwanted.

    We have been using /var/lib/ganeti/export for exported instance data
    since 2.0.1-1 and changing the location now will break imports in
    existing setups, so it's best to just skip backing up DATADIR/export.
