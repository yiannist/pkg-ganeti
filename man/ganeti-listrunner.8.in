.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]ganeti-listrunner\f[] is a tool to run commands in parallel
over multiple machines. It differs from \f[B]dsh\f[] or other tools
in that it asks for the password once (if not using
\f[B]ssh-agent\f[]) and then reuses the password to connect to all
machines, thus being easily usable even when public key
authentication or Kerberos authentication is not available.
.PP
It can run either a command or a script (which gets uploaded first
and deleted after execution) on a list of hosts provided either via
a file (one host per line) or as a comma-separated list on the
commandline. The output (stdout and stderr are merged) of the
remote execution is written to a logfile. One logfile per host is
written.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The options that can be passed to the program are as follows:
.TP
.B \f[B]-l\f[] \f[I]logdir\f[]
The directory under which the logfiles files should be written.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]-x\f[] \f[I]executable\f[]
The executable to copy and run on the target hosts.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]-c\f[] \f[I]shell-cmd\f[]
The shell command to run on the remote hosts.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]-f\f[] \f[I]hostfile\f[]
The file with the target hosts, one hostname per line.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]-h\f[] \f[I]hostlist\f[]
Comma-separated list of target hosts.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]-a\f[] \f[I]aux-file\f[]
A file to copy to the target hosts. Can be given multiple times, in
which case all files will be copied to the temporary directory. The
executable or the shell command will be run from the (temporary)
directory where these files have been copied.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]-b\f[] \f[I]batch-size\f[]
The host list will be split into batches of batch-size which will
be processed in parallel. The default if 15, and should be
increased if faster processing is needed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]-u\f[] \f[I]username\f[]
Username to connect as instead of the default root username.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]-A\f[]
Use an existing ssh-agent instead of password authentication.
.RS
.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
The exist status of the command will be zero, unless it was aborted
in some way (e.g. ^C).
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Run a command on a list of hosts:
.PP
\f[CR]
      listrunner\ -l\ logdir\ -c\ "uname\ -a"\ -h\ host1,host2,host3
\f[]
.PP
Upload a script, some auxiliary files and run the script:
.PP
\f[CR]
      listrunner\ -l\ logdir\ -x\ runme.sh\ \\
      \ \ -a\ seed.dat\ -a\ golden.dat\ \\
      \ \ -h\ host1,host2,host3
\f[]
