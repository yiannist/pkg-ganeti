.SH Name
.PP
gnt-storage - Ganeti storage administration
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]gnt-storage\f[] {command} [arguments...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]gnt-storage\f[] is used for managing the available storage
inside the Ganeti cluster.
At the moment, it manages only external storage (ExtStorage).
.SH COMMANDS
.SS DIAGNOSE
.PP
\f[B]diagnose\f[]
.PP
This command provides detailed information about the state of all
ExtStorage providers available in the Ganeti cluster.
The state of each provider is calculated per nodegroup.
This means that a provider may be valid (meaning usable) for some
nodegroups, and invalid (not usable) for some others.
This command will help you see why an installed ExtStorage provider is
not valid for a specific nodegroup.
It could be that it is missing from a node, or is only partially
installed.
This command will show the details of all ExtStorage providers and the
reasons they are or aren\[aq]t valid for every nodegroup in the cluster.
.SS INFO
.PP
\f[B]info\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
[\f[I]provider\f[]]
.PP
This command will list detailed information about each ExtStorage
provider found in the cluster, including its nodegroup validity, the
supported parameters (if any) and their documentations, etc.
.PP
For each ExtStorage provider only the valid nodegroups will be listed.
.PP
If run with no arguments, it will display info for all ExtStorage
providers found in the cluster.
If given ExtStorage provider\[aq]s names as arguments it will list info
only for providers given.
.SH NOTES
.PP
In the future \f[B]gnt-storage\f[] can be extended to also handle
internal storage (such as lvm, drbd, etc) and also provide diagnostics
for them too.
.PP
It can also be extended to handle internal and external storage pools,
if/when this kind of abstraction is implemented inside Ganeti.
.SH REPORTING BUGS
.PP
