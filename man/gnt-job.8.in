.SH NAME
gnt-job \- job commands
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgnt-job \fR \fBcommand\fR [ \fBarguments...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBgnt-job\fR is used for examining and
manipulating the job queue.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.SS "ARCHIVE"

\fBarchive\fR \fBid\fR\fI ...\fR

.PP
This command can be used to archive job by their IDs. Only
jobs that have finished execution (i.e either
\fBsuccess\fR, \fBerror\fR or
\fBcanceled\fR jobs).
.SS "AUTOARCHIVE"

\fBautoarchive\fR { \fB\fIage\fB\fR | \fBall\fR }

.PP
Archive jobs by their age. This command can archive jobs older
than \fIage\fR seconds, or alternatively
all finished jobs can be archived if the string all
is passed.
.SS "CANCEL"

\fBcancel\fR \fB\fIid\fB\fR

.PP
Cancel the job identified by the given
\fIid\fR\&. Only jobs that have not yet
started to run can be canceled; that is, jobs in either the
\fBqueued\fR or \fBwaiting\fR
state.
.SS "INFO"

\fBinfo\fR \fB\fIid\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.PP
Show detailed information about the given job id(s). If no job
id is given, all jobs are examined (warning, this is a lot of
information).
.SS "LIST"

\fBlist\fR [ \fB--no-headers\fR ] [ \fB--separator=\fISEPARATOR\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB-o \fI[+]FIELD,...\fB\fR ]
   

.PP
Lists the jobs and their status. By default, the job id, job
status, and a small job description is listed, but additional
parameters can be selected.
.PP
The \fB--no-headers\fR option will skip the initial
header line. The \fB--separator\fR option takes an
argument which denotes what will be used between the output
fields. Both these options are to help scripting.
.PP
The \fB-o\fR option takes a comma-separated list of
output fields. The available fields and their meaning are:
.TP
\fBid\fR
the job id
.TP
\fBstatus\fR
the status of the job
.TP
\fBreceived_ts\fR
the timestamp the job was received
.TP
\fBstart_ts\fR
the timestamp when the job was started
.TP
\fBend_ts\fR
the timestamp when the job was ended
.TP
\fBsummary\fR
a summary of the opcodes that define the job
.TP
\fBops\fR
the list of opcodes defining the job
.TP
\fBopresult\fR
the list of opcode results
.TP
\fBopstatus\fR
the list of opcode statuses
.TP
\fBoplog\fR
the list of opcode logs
.TP
\fBopstart\fR
the list of opcode start times
.TP
\fBopend\fR
the list of opcode end times
.TP
\fBlock_status\fR
the lock status (useful for debugging)
.PP
If the value of the option starts with the character
+, the new fields will be added to the
default list. This allows to quickly see the default list plus
a few other fields, instead of retyping the entire list of
fields.
.SS "WATCH"

\fBwatch\fR [ \fBid\fR ]

.PP
This command follows the output of the job by the given
\fIid\fR and prints it.
