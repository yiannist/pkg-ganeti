ganeti-kvmd - Ganeti KVM daemon
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]ganeti-kvmd\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The KVM daemon is responsible for determining whether a given KVM
instance was shutdown by an administrator or a user.
.PP
The KVM daemon monitors, using \f[C]inotify\f[], KVM instances through
their QMP sockets, which are provided by KVM.
Using the QMP sockets, the KVM daemon listens for particular shutdown,
powerdown, and stop events which will determine if a given instance was
shutdown by the user or Ganeti, and this result is communicated to
Ganeti via a special file in the filesystem.
.SH FILES
.PP
The KVM daemon monitors Qmp sockets of KVM instances, which are created
in the KVM control directory, located under
\f[C]@LOCALSTATEDIR@/run/ganeti/kvm-hypervisor/ctrl/\f[].
The KVM daemon also creates shutdown files in this directory.
Finally, the KVM daemon\[aq]s log file is located under
\f[C]@LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/ganeti/ganeti-kvmd.log\f[].
Removal of the KVM control directory, the shutdown files, or the log
file, will lead to no errors on the KVM daemon.
