.SH NAME
ganeti-rapi \- ganeti remote API daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBganeti-rapi \fR [ \fB-d\fR ] [ \fB-f\fR ] [ \fB--no-ssl\fR ] [ \fB-K \fISSL_KEY_FILE\fB\fR ] [ \fB-C \fISSL_CERT_FILE\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBganeti-rapi\fR is the daemon providing a remote
API for Ganeti clusters.
.PP
It is automatically started on the master node, and by default
it uses SSL encryption. This can be disabled by passing the
\fB--no-ssl\fR option, or alternatively the
certificate used can be changed via the \fB-C\fR
option and the key via the \fB-K\fR option.
.PP
The daemon will listen to the "ganeti-rapi" tcp port, as listed in the
system services database, or to port 5080 by default.
.PP
See the \fBGaneti remote API\fR documentation for
further information.
.PP
Requests are logged to
\fI@LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/ganeti/rapi-daemon.log\fR,
in the same format as for the node and master daemon.
.SH "ACCESS CONTROLS"
.PP
All query operations are allowed without authentication. Only
the modification operations require authentication, in the form
of basic authentication.
.PP
The users and their rights are defined in a file named
\fIrapi_users\fR, located in the \fI@LOCALSTATEDIR@/ganeti\fR
directory. The users should be listed one per line, in the
following format:

.nf
username password options
.fi
.PP
Currently the \fIoptions\fR field should
equal the string \fBwrite\fR in order to actually
give write permission for the given users. Example:

.nf
rclient   secret    write
guest   tespw
.fi
.PP
The first user (\fBrclient\fR) will have
read-write rights, whereas the second user does only have read
(query) rights, and as such is no different than not using
authentication at all.
