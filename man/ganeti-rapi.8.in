.SH Name
.PP
ganeti-rapi - Ganeti remote API daemon
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]ganeti-rapi\f[] [-d] [-f] [--no-ssl] [-K
\f[I]SSL_KEY_FILE\f[]] [-C \f[I]SSL_CERT_FILE\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]ganeti-rapi\f[] is the daemon providing a remote API for
Ganeti clusters.
.PP
It is automatically started on the master node, and by default it
uses SSL encryption. This can be disabled by passing the
\f[B]--no-ssl\f[] option, or alternatively the certificate used can
be changed via the \f[B]-C\f[] option and the key via the
\f[B]-K\f[] option.
.PP
The daemon will listen to the "ganeti-rapi" tcp port, as listed in
the system services database, or if not defined, to port 5080 by
default.
.PP
See the \f[I]Ganeti remote API\f[] documentation for further
information.
.PP
Requests are logged to
\f[B]@LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/ganeti/rapi-daemon.log\f[], in the same
format as for the node and master daemon.
.SH ACCESS CONTROLS
.PP
All query operations are allowed without authentication. Only the
modification operations require authentication, in the form of
basic authentication.
.PP
The users and their rights are defined in the
\f[B]@LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/rapi/users\f[] file. The users
should be listed one per line, in the following format:
.PP
\f[CR]
      username\ password\ options
\f[]
.PP
Currently the \f[I]options\f[] field should equal the string
\f[B]write\f[] in order to actually give write permission for the
given users. Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      rclient\ \ \ secret\ \ \ \ write
      guest\ \ \ \ \ testpw
\f[]
.PP
The first user (\f[I]rclient\f[]) has read-write rights, whereas
the second user (\f[I]guest\f[]) only has read (query) rights, and
as such is no different than not using authentication at all.
.PP
More details (including on how to use hashed passwords) can be
found in the Ganeti documentation.
