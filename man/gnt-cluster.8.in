.TH "GNT-CLUSTER" "8" "16 June 2009" "ganeti 2.0" ""

.SH NAME
gnt-cluster \- ganeti administration, cluster-wide
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgnt-cluster \fR \fBcommand\fR [ \fBarguments...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBgnt-cluster\fR is used for cluster-wide
administration in the ganeti system.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.SS "ADD-TAGS"

\fBadd-tags\fR [ \fB--from \fIfile\fB\fR ] \fB\fItag\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.PP
Add tags to the cluster. If any of the tags contains invalid
characters, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \fB--from\fR option is given, the list of
tags will be extended with the contents of that file (each
line becomes a tag). In this case, there is not need to pass
tags on the command line (if you do, both sources will be
used). A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.
.SS "COMMAND"

\fBcommand\fR [ \fB-n \fInode\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR

.PP
Executes a command on all nodes. If the option
\fB-n\fR is not given, the command will be executed
on all nodes, otherwise it will be executed only on the
node(s) specified. Use the option multiple times for running
it on multiple nodes, like:

.nf
          # gnt-cluster command -n node1.example.com -n node2.example.com date
        
.fi
.PP
The command is executed serially on the selected nodes. If the
master node is present in the list, the command will be
executed last on the master. Regarding the other nodes, the
execution order is somewhat alphabetic, so that
node2.example.com will be earlier than node10.example.com but
after node1.example.com.
.PP
So given the node names node1, node2, node3, node10, node11,
with node3 being the master, the order will be: node1, node2,
node10, node11, node3.
.PP
The command is constructed by concatenating all other command
line arguments. For example, to list the contents of the
\fI/etc\fR directory on all
nodes, run:

.nf
          # gnt-cluster command ls -l /etc
        
.fi
and the command which will be executed will be
"ls -l /etc"
.SS "COPYFILE"

\fBcopyfile\fR [ \fB-n \fInode\fB\fR ] \fB\fIfile\fB\fR

.PP
Copies a file to all or to some nodes. The argument specifies
the source file (on the current system), the
\fB-n\fR argument specifies the target node, or
nodes if the option is given multiple times. If
\fB-n\fR is not given at all, the file will be
copied to all nodes.
Example:

.nf
          # gnt-cluster -n node1.example.com -n node2.example.com copyfile /tmp/test
        
.fi
This will copy the file \fI/tmp/test\fR from
the current node to the two named nodes.
.SS "DESTROY"

\fBdestroy\fR \fB--yes-do-it\fR

.PP
Remove all configuration files related to the cluster, so that
a \fBgnt-cluster init\fR can be done again
afterwards.
.PP
Since this is a dangerous command, you are required to pass
the argument \fI--yes-do-it.\fR
.SS "GETMASTER"

\fBgetmaster\fR

.PP
Displays the current master node.
.SS "INFO"

\fBinfo\fR

.PP
Shows runtime cluster information: cluster name, architecture
(32 or 64 bit), master node, node list and instance list.
.SS "INIT"

\fBinit\fR
    [ \fB-s \fIsecondary_ip\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB-b \fIbridge\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB-g \fIvg-name\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB--master-netdev \fIvg-name\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB-m \fImac-prefix\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB--no-lvm-storage\fR ]
    [ \fB--file-storage-dir \fIdir\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB--enabled-hypervisors \fIhypervisors\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB-t \fIhypervisor name\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB--hypervisor-parameters \fIhypervisor\fB:\fIhv-param\fB=\fIvalue\fB [ ,\fIhv-param\fB=\fIvalue\fB\fI ...\fB ]\fR ]
    [ \fB--backend-parameters \fIbe-param\fB=\fIvalue\fB [ ,\fIbe-param\fB=\fIvalue\fB\fI ...\fB ]\fR ]
    \fB\fIclustername\fB\fR

.PP
This commands is only run once initially on the first node of
the cluster. It will initialize the cluster configuration and
setup ssh-keys and more.
.PP
Note that the \fIclustername\fR is not
any random name. It has to be resolvable to an IP address
using DNS, and it is best if you give the fully-qualified
domain name. This hostname must resolve to an IP address
reserved exclusively for this purpose.
.PP
The cluster can run in two modes: single-home or
dual-homed. In the first case, all traffic (both public
traffic, inter-node traffic and data replication traffic) goes
over the same interface. In the dual-homed case, the data
replication traffic goes over the second network. The
\fB-s\fR option here marks the cluster as
dual-homed and its parameter represents this node's address on
the second network. If you initialise the cluster with
\fB-s\fR, all nodes added must have a secondary IP
as well.
.PP
Note that for Ganeti it doesn't matter if the secondary
network is actually a separate physical network, or is done
using tunneling, etc. For performance reasons, it's
recommended to use a separate network, of course.
.PP
The \fB-b\fR option specifies the default bridge
for instances.
.PP
The \fB-g\fR option will let you specify a volume group
different than 'xenvg' for ganeti to use when creating instance disks.
This volume group must have the same name on all nodes. Once the
cluster is initialized this can be altered by using the
\fBmodify\fR command. If you don't want to use lvm
storage at all use the \fB--no-lvm-storage\fR option.
Once the cluster is initialized you can change this setup with the
\fBmodify\fR command.
.PP
The \fB--master-netdev\fR option is useful for specifying a
different interface on which the master will activate its IP address.
It's important that all nodes have this interface because you'll need
it for a master failover.
.PP
The \fB-m\fR option will let you specify a three byte prefix
under which the virtual MAC addresses of your instances will be
generated. The prefix must be specified in the format XX:XX:XX and the
default is aa:00:00.
.PP
The \fB--no-lvm-storage\fR allows you to initialize the
cluster without lvm support. This means that only instances using
files as storage backend will be possible to create. Once the cluster
is initialized you can change this setup with the
\fBmodify\fR command.
.PP
The \fB--file-storage-dir\fR option allows you
set the directory to use for storing the instance disk
files when using file storage as backend for instance disks.
.PP
The \fB--enabled-hypervisors\fR option allows you
to set the list of hypervisors that will be enabled for
this cluster. Instance hypervisors can only be choosen from
the list of enabled hypervisors. Currently, the following
hypervisors are available:
.PP
.TP
\fBxen-pvm\fR
Xen PVM hypervisor
.TP
\fBxen-hvm\fR
Xen HVM hypervisor
.TP
\fBkvm\fR
Linux KVM hypervisor
.TP
\fBfake\fR
fake hypervisor for development/testing
.PP
Either a single hypervisor name or a comma-separated list of
hypervisor names can be specified. If this option is not
specified, only the xen-pvm hypervisor is enabled by default.
.PP
With the \fB-t\fR option, the default hypervisor
can be set. It has to be a member of the list of enabled
hypervisors. If not specified, the first entry on the list of
enabled hypervisors will be used by default.
.PP
The \fB--backend\fR option allows you to set
the default backend parameters for the cluster. The parameter
format is a comma-separated list of key=value pairs with the
following supported keys:
.PP
.TP
\fBvcpus\fR
Number of VCPUs to set for an instance by default, must
be an integer, will be set to 1 if no specified.
.TP
\fBmemory\fR
Amount of memory to allocate for an instance by default,
can be either an integer or an integer followed by a
unit (M for mebibytes and G for gibibytes are
supported), will be set to 128M if not specified.
.TP
\fBauto_balance\fR
Value of the auto_balance flag for instances to use by
default, will be set to true if not specified.
.PP
The \fB--hypervisor-parameters\fR option allows you
to set default hypervisor specific parameters for the
cluster. The format of this option is the name of the
hypervisor, followed by a colon and a comma-separated list of
key=value pairs. The keys available for each hypervisors are
detailed int the \fBgnt-instance\fR(8) man page, in the
\fBadd\fR command.
.SS "LIST-TAGS"

\fBlist-tags\fR

.PP
List the tags of the cluster.
.SS "MASTERFAILOVER"

\fBmasterfailover\fR

.PP
Failover the master role to the current node.
.SS "MODIFY"

\fBmodify\fR
    [ \fB-g \fIvg-name\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB--no-lvm-storage\fR ]
    [ \fB--enabled-hypervisors
\fIhypervisors\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB--hypervisor-parameters \fIhypervisor\fB:\fIhv-param\fB=\fIvalue\fB [ ,\fIhv-param\fB=\fIvalue\fB\fI ...\fB ]\fR ]
    [ \fB--backend-parameters \fIbe-param\fB=\fIvalue\fB [ ,\fIbe-param\fB=\fIvalue\fB\fI ...\fB ]\fR ]
    [ \fB-C \fIcandidate_pool_size\fB\fR ]

.PP
Modify the options for the cluster.
.PP
The \fB-g\fR, \fB--no-lvm-storarge\fR,
\fB--enabled-hypervisors\fR,
\fB--hypervisor-parameters\fR and
\fB--backend-parameters\fR options are
described in the \fBinit\fR command.
.PP
The \fB-C\fR options specifies the
candidate_pool_size cluster parameter. This
is the number of nodes that the master will try to keep as
master_candidates\&. For more details about
this role and other node roles, see the \fBganeti\fR(7)\&. If you increase the size, the master will
automatically promote as many nodes as required and possible
to reach the intended number.
.SS "QUEUE"

\fBqueue\fR [ \fBdrain\fR ] [ \fBundrain\fR ] [ \fBinfo\fR ]

.PP
Change job queue properties.
.PP
The \fBdrain\fR option sets the drain flag on the
job queue. No new jobs will be accepted, but jobs already in
the queue will be processed.
.PP
The \fBundrain\fR will unset the drain flag on the
job queue. New jobs will be accepted.
.PP
The \fBinfo\fR option shows the properties of the
job queue.
.SS "REDIST-CONF"

\fBredist-conf\fR [ \fB--submit\fR ]

.PP
This command forces a full push of configuration files from
the master node to the other nodes in the cluster. This is
normally not needed, but can be run if the
\fBverify\fR complains about configuration
mismatches.
.PP
The \fB--submit\fR option is used to send the job
to the master daemon but not wait for its completion. The job
ID will be shown so that it can be examined via
\fBgnt-job info\fR\&.
.SS "REMOVE-TAGS"

\fBremove-tags\fR [ \fB--from \fIfile\fB\fR ] \fB\fItag\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.PP
Remove tags from the cluster. If any of the tags are not
existing on the cluster, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \fB--from\fR option is given, the list of
tags will be extended with the contents of that file (each
line becomes a tag). In this case, there is not need to pass
tags on the command line (if you do, both sources will be
used). A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.
.SS "RENAME"

\fBrename\fR [ \fB-f\fR ] \fB\fIname\fB\fR

.PP
Renames the cluster and in the process updates the master IP
address to the one the new name resolves to. At least one of
either the name or the IP address must be different, otherwise
the operation will be aborted.
.PP
Note that since this command can be dangerous (especially when
run over SSH), the command will require confirmation unless
run with the \fB-f\fR option.
.SS "SEARCH-TAGS"

\fBsearch-tags\fR \fB\fIpattern\fB\fR

.PP
Searches the tags on all objects in the cluster (the cluster
itself, the nodes and the instances) for a given pattern. The
pattern is interpreted as a regular expression and a search
will be done on it (i.e. the given pattern is not anchored to
the beggining of the string; if you want that, prefix the
pattern with ^).
.PP
If no tags are matching the pattern, the exit code of the
command will be one. If there is at least one match, the exit
code will be zero. Each match is listed on one line, the
object and the tag separated by a space. The cluster will be
listed as \fI/cluster\fR, a node will be listed
as
\fI/nodes/name\fR,
and an instance as
\fI/instances/name\fR\&.
Example:

.nf
# gnt-cluster search-tags time
/cluster ctime:2007-09-01
/nodes/node1.example.com mtime:2007-10-04
.fi
.SS "VERIFY"

\fBverify\fR [ \fB--no-nplus1-mem\fR ]

.PP
Verify correctness of cluster configuration. This is safe with
respect to running instances, and incurs no downtime of the
instances.
.PP
If the \fB--no-nplus1-mem\fR option is given, ganeti won't
check whether if it loses a node it can restart all the instances on
their secondaries (and report an error otherwise).
.SS "VERIFY-DISKS"

\fBverify-disks\fR

.PP
The command checks which instances have degraded DRBD disks
and activates the disks of those instances.
.PP
This command is run from the \fBganeti-watcher\fR
tool, which also has a different, complementary algorithm for
doing this check. Together, these two should ensure that DRBD
disks are kept consistent.
.SS "VERSION"

\fBversion\fR

.PP
Show the cluster version.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.PP
Report bugs to  <URL:http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/> or contact the
