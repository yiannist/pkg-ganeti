gnt-cluster - Ganeti administration, cluster-wide
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]gnt-cluster\f[] {command} [arguments...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]gnt-cluster\f[] is used for cluster-wide administration in
the Ganeti system.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS ADD-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]add-tags\f[] [--from \f[I]file\f[]] {\f[I]tag\f[]...}
.PP
Add tags to the cluster. If any of the tags contains invalid
characters, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \f[B]--from\f[] option is given, the list of tags will be
extended with the contents of that file (each line becomes a tag).
In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the command line
(if you do, both sources will be used). A file name of - will be
interpreted as stdin.
.SS COMMAND
.PP
\f[B]command\f[] [-n \f[I]node\f[]] {\f[I]command\f[]}
.PP
Executes a command on all nodes. If the option \f[B]-n\f[] is not
given, the command will be executed on all nodes, otherwise it will
be executed only on the node(s) specified. Use the option multiple
times for running it on multiple nodes, like:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-cluster\ command\ -n\ node1.example.com\ -n\ node2.example.com\ date
\f[]
.PP
The command is executed serially on the selected nodes. If the
master node is present in the list, the command will be executed
last on the master. Regarding the other nodes, the execution order
is somewhat alphabetic, so that node2.example.com will be earlier
than node10.example.com but after node1.example.com.
.PP
So given the node names node1, node2, node3, node10, node11, with
node3 being the master, the order will be: node1, node2, node10,
node11, node3.
.PP
The command is constructed by concatenating all other command line
arguments. For example, to list the contents of the /etc directory
on all nodes, run:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-cluster\ command\ ls\ -l\ /etc
\f[]
.PP
and the command which will be executed will be
\f[B]ls\ -l\ /etc\f[].
.SS COPYFILE
.PP
\f[B]copyfile\f[] [--use-replication-network] [-n \f[I]node\f[]]
{\f[I]file\f[]}
.PP
Copies a file to all or to some nodes. The argument specifies the
source file (on the current system), the \f[B]-n\f[] argument
specifies the target node, or nodes if the option is given multiple
times. If \f[B]-n\f[] is not given at all, the file will be copied
to all nodes. Passing the \f[B]--use-replication-network\f[] option
will cause the copy to be done over the replication network (only
matters if the primary/secondary IPs are different). Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-cluster\ -n\ node1.example.com\ -n\ node2.example.com\ copyfile\ /tmp/test
\f[]
.PP
This will copy the file /tmp/test from the current node to the two
named nodes.
.SS DESTROY
.PP
\f[B]destroy\f[] {--yes-do-it}
.PP
Remove all configuration files related to the cluster, so that a
\f[B]gnt-cluster init\f[] can be done again afterwards.
.PP
Since this is a dangerous command, you are required to pass the
argument \f[I]--yes-do-it.\f[]
.SS GETMASTER
.PP
\f[B]getmaster\f[]
.PP
Displays the current master node.
.SS INFO
.PP
\f[B]info\f[] [--roman]
.PP
Shows runtime cluster information: cluster name, architecture (32
or 64 bit), master node, node list and instance list.
.PP
Passing the \f[B]--roman\f[] option gnt-cluster info will try to
print its integer fields in a latin friendly way. This allows
further diffusion of Ganeti among ancient cultures.

{\f[I]clustername\f[]}
.PP
This commands is only run once initially on the first node of the
cluster. It will initialize the cluster configuration, setup the
ssh-keys, start the daemons on the master node, etc. in order to
have a working one-node cluster.
.PP
Note that the \f[I]clustername\f[] is not any random name. It has
to be resolvable to an IP address using DNS, and it is best if you
give the fully-qualified domain name. This hostname must resolve to
an IP address reserved exclusively for this purpose, i.e. not
already in use.
.PP
The cluster can run in two modes: single-home or dual-homed. In the
first case, all traffic (both public traffic, inter-node traffic
and data replication traffic) goes over the same interface. In the
dual-homed case, the data replication traffic goes over the second
network. The \f[B]-s\ (--secondary-ip)\f[] option here marks the
cluster as dual-homed and its parameter represents this node\[aq]s
address on the second network. If you initialise the cluster with
\f[B]-s\f[], all nodes added must have a secondary IP as well.
.PP
Note that for Ganeti it doesn\[aq]t matter if the secondary network
is actually a separate physical network, or is done using
tunneling, etc. For performance reasons, it\[aq]s recommended to
use a separate network, of course.
.PP
The \f[B]--vg-name\f[] option will let you specify a volume group
different than "xenvg" for Ganeti to use when creating instance
disks. This volume group must have the same name on all nodes. Once
the cluster is initialized this can be altered by using the
\f[B]modify\f[] command. If you don\[aq]t want to use lvm storage
at all use the \f[B]--no-lvm-storage\f[] option. Once the cluster
is initialized you can change this setup with the \f[B]modify\f[]
command.
.PP
The \f[B]--master-netdev\f[] option is useful for specifying a
different interface on which the master will activate its IP
address. It\[aq]s important that all nodes have this interface
because you\[aq]ll need it for a master failover.
.PP
The \f[B]-m\ (--mac-prefix)\f[] option will let you specify a three
byte prefix under which the virtual MAC addresses of your instances
will be generated. The prefix must be specified in the format
\f[B]XX:XX:XX\f[] and the default is \f[B]aa:00:00\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]--no-lvm-storage\f[] option allows you to initialize the
cluster without lvm support. This means that only instances using
files as storage backend will be possible to create. Once the
cluster is initialized you can change this setup with the
\f[B]modify\f[] command.
.PP
The \f[B]--no-etc-hosts\f[] option allows you to initialize the
cluster without modifying the /etc/hosts file.
.PP
The \f[B]--no-ssh-init\f[] option allows you to initialize the
cluster without creating or distributing SSH key pairs.
.PP
The \f[B]--file-storage-dir\f[] option allows you set the directory
to use for storing the instance disk files when using file storage
as backend for instance disks.
.PP
The \f[B]--prealloc-wipe-disks\f[] sets a cluster wide
configuration value for wiping disks prior to allocation. This
increases security on instance level as the instance can\[aq]t
access untouched data from it\[aq]s underlying storage.
.PP
The \f[B]--enabled-hypervisors\f[] option allows you to set the
list of hypervisors that will be enabled for this cluster. Instance
hypervisors can only be chosen from the list of enabled
hypervisors, and the first entry of this list will be used by
default. Currently, the following hypervisors are available:
.TP
.B xen-pvm
Xen PVM hypervisor
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B xen-hvm
Xen HVM hypervisor
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B kvm
Linux KVM hypervisor
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B chroot
a simple chroot manager that starts chroot based on a script at the
root of the filesystem holding the chroot
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B fake
fake hypervisor for development/testing
.RS
.RE
.PP
Either a single hypervisor name or a comma-separated list of
hypervisor names can be specified. If this option is not specified,
only the xen-pvm hypervisor is enabled by default.
.PP
The \f[B]-H\ (--hypervisor-parameters)\f[] option allows you to set
default hypervisor specific parameters for the cluster. The format
of this option is the name of the hypervisor, followed by a colon
and a comma-separated list of key=value pairs. The keys available
for each hypervisors are detailed in the gnt-instance(8) man page,
in the \f[B]add\f[] command plus the following parameters which are
only configurable globally (at cluster level):
.TP
.B migration_port
Valid for the Xen PVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
This options specifies the TCP port to use for live-migration. For
Xen, the same port should be configured on all nodes in the
\f[B]/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp\f[] file, under the key
"xend-relocation-port".
.RE
.TP
.B migration_bandwidth
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
This option specifies the maximum bandwidth that KVM will use for
instance live migrations. The value is in MiB/s.
.PP
This option is only effective with kvm versions >= 78 and qemu-kvm
versions >= 0.10.0.
.RE
.PP
The \f[B]-B\ (--backend-parameters)\f[] option allows you to set
the default backend parameters for the cluster. The parameter
format is a comma-separated list of key=value pairs with the
following supported keys:
.TP
.B vcpus
Number of VCPUs to set for an instance by default, must be an
integer, will be set to 1 if no specified.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B memory
Amount of memory to allocate for an instance by default, can be
either an integer or an integer followed by a unit (M for mebibytes
and G for gibibytes are supported), will be set to 128M if not
specified.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B auto_balance
Value of the auto_balance flag for instances to use by default,
will be set to true if not specified.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The \f[B]-N\ (--nic-parameters)\f[] option allows you to set the
default nic parameters for the cluster. The parameter format is a
comma-separated list of key=value pairs with the following
supported keys:
.TP
.B mode
The default nic mode, \[aq]routed\[aq] or \[aq]bridged\[aq].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B link
In bridged mode the default NIC bridge. In routed mode it
represents an hypervisor-vif-script dependent value to allow
different instance groups. For example under the KVM default
network script it is interpreted as a routing table number or name.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The option \f[B]--maintain-node-health\f[] allows one to
enable/disable automatic maintenance actions on nodes. Currently
these include automatic shutdown of instances and deactivation of
DRBD devices on offline nodes; in the future it might be extended
to automatic removal of unknown LVM volumes, etc.
.PP
The \f[B]--uid-pool\f[] option initializes the user-id pool. The
\f[I]user-id pool definition\f[] can contain a list of user-ids
and/or a list of user-id ranges. The parameter format is a
comma-separated list of numeric user-ids or user-id ranges. The
ranges are defined by a lower and higher boundary, separated by a
dash. The boundaries are inclusive. If the \f[B]--uid-pool\f[]
option is not supplied, the user-id pool is initialized to an empty
list. An empty list means that the user-id pool feature is
disabled.
.PP
The \f[B]-I\ (--default-iallocator)\f[] option specifies the
default instance allocator. The instance allocator will be used for
operations like instance creation, instance and node migration,
etc. when no manual override is specified. If this option is not
specified, the default instance allocator will be blank, which
means that relevant operations will require the administrator to
manually specify either an instance allocator, or a set of nodes.
The default iallocator can be changed later using the
\f[B]modify\f[] command.
.PP
The \f[B]--primary-ip-version\f[] option specifies the IP version
used for the primary address. Possible values are 4 and 6 for IPv4
and IPv6, respectively. This option is used when resolving node
names and the cluster name.
.PP
The \f[B]--node-parameters\f[] option allows you to set default
node parameters for the cluster. Please see \f[B]ganeti\f[](7) for
more information about supported key=value pairs.
.PP
The \f[B]-C\ (--candidate-pool-size)\f[] option specifies the
\f[B]candidate_pool_size\f[] cluster parameter. This is the number
of nodes that the master will try to keep as master_candidates. For
more details about this role and other node roles, see the
ganeti(7).
.SS LIST-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]list-tags\f[]
.PP
List the tags of the cluster.
.SS MASTER-FAILOVER
.PP
\f[B]master-failover\f[] [--no-voting]
.PP
Failover the master role to the current node.
.PP
The \f[B]--no-voting\f[] option skips the remote node agreement
checks. This is dangerous, but necessary in some cases (for example
failing over the master role in a 2 node cluster with the original
master down). If the original master then comes up, it won\[aq]t be
able to start its master daemon because it won\[aq]t have enough
votes, but so won\[aq]t the new master, if the master daemon ever
needs a restart. You can pass \f[B]--no-voting\f[] to
\f[B]ganeti-masterd\f[] on the new master to solve this problem,
and run \f[B]gnt-cluster redist-conf\f[] to make sure the cluster
is consistent again.
.SS MASTER-PING
.PP
\f[B]master-ping\f[]
.PP
Checks if the master daemon is alive.
.PP
If the master daemon is alive and can respond to a basic query (the
equivalent of \f[B]gnt-cluster info\f[]), then the exit code of the
command will be 0. If the master daemon is not alive (either due to
a crash or because this is not the master node), the exit code will
be 1.

command.
.PP
The \f[B]--add-uids\f[] and \f[B]--remove-uids\f[] options can be
used to modify the user-id pool by adding/removing a list of
user-ids or user-id ranges.
.PP
The option \f[B]--reserved-lvs\f[] specifies a list
(comma-separated) of logical volume group names (regular
expressions) that will be ignored by the cluster verify operation.
This is useful if the volume group used for Ganeti is shared with
the system for other uses. Note that it\[aq]s not recommended to
create and mark as ignored logical volume names which match
Ganeti\[aq]s own name format (starting with UUID and then .diskN),
as this option only skips the verification, but not the actual use
of the names given.
.PP
To remove all reserved logical volumes, pass in an empty argument
to the option, as in \f[B]--reserved-lvs=\f[] or
\f[B]--reserved-lvs\ \[aq]\[aq]\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]-I\ (--default-iallocator)\f[] is described in the
\f[B]init\f[] command. To clear the default iallocator, just pass
an empty string (\[aq]\[aq]).
.SS QUEUE
.PP
\f[B]queue\f[] {drain | undrain | info}
.PP
Change job queue properties.
.PP
The \f[B]drain\f[] option sets the drain flag on the job queue. No
new jobs will be accepted, but jobs already in the queue will be
processed.
.PP
The \f[B]undrain\f[] will unset the drain flag on the job queue.
New jobs will be accepted.
.PP
The \f[B]info\f[] option shows the properties of the job queue.
.SS WATCHER
.PP
\f[B]watcher\f[] {pause \f[I]duration\f[] | continue | info}
.PP
Make the watcher pause or let it continue.
.PP
The \f[B]pause\f[] option causes the watcher to pause for
\f[I]duration\f[] seconds.
.PP
The \f[B]continue\f[] option will let the watcher continue.
.PP
The \f[B]info\f[] option shows whether the watcher is currently
paused.
.SS redist-conf
.PP
\f[B]redist-conf\f[] [--submit]
.PP
This command forces a full push of configuration files from the
master node to the other nodes in the cluster. This is normally not
needed, but can be run if the \f[B]verify\f[] complains about
configuration mismatches.
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so
that it can be examined via \f[B]gnt-job info\f[].
.SS REMOVE-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]remove-tags\f[] [--from \f[I]file\f[]] {\f[I]tag\f[]...}
.PP
Remove tags from the cluster. If any of the tags are not existing
on the cluster, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \f[B]--from\f[] option is given, the list of tags to be
removed will be extended with the contents of that file (each line
becomes a tag). In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the
command line (if you do, tags from both sources will be removed). A
file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.
.SS RENAME
.PP
\f[B]rename\f[] [-f] {\f[I]name\f[]}
.PP
Renames the cluster and in the process updates the master IP
address to the one the new name resolves to. At least one of either
the name or the IP address must be different, otherwise the
operation will be aborted.
.PP
Note that since this command can be dangerous (especially when run
over SSH), the command will require confirmation unless run with
the \f[B]-f\f[] option.

.PP
This command will stop all Ganeti daemons in the cluster and start
them again once the new certificates and keys are replicated. The
options \f[B]--new-cluster-certificate\f[] and
\f[B]--new-confd-hmac-key\f[] can be used to regenerate the
cluster-internal SSL certificate respective the HMAC key used by
ganeti-confd(8).
.PP
To generate a new self-signed RAPI certificate (used by
ganeti-rapi(8)) specify \f[B]--new-rapi-certificate\f[].
If you want to use your own certificate, e.g. one signed by a
certificate authority (CA), pass its filename to
\f[B]--rapi-certificate\f[].
.PP
\f[B]--new-cluster-domain-secret\f[] generates a new, random
cluster domain secret. \f[B]--cluster-domain-secret\f[] reads the
secret from a file. The cluster domain secret is used to sign
information exchanged between separate clusters via a third party.
.SS REPAIR-DISK-SIZES
.PP
\f[B]repair-disk-sizes\f[] [instance...]
.PP
This command checks that the recorded size of the given
instance\[aq]s disks matches the actual size and updates any
mismatches found. This is needed if the Ganeti configuration is no
longer consistent with reality, as it will impact some disk
operations. If no arguments are given, all instances will be
checked.
.PP
Note that only active disks can be checked by this command; in case
a disk cannot be activated it\[aq]s advised to use
\f[B]gnt-instance activate-disks --ignore-size ...\f[] to force
activation without regard to the current size.
.PP
When the all disk sizes are consistent, the command will return no
output. Otherwise it will log details about the inconsistencies in
the configuration.
.SS SEARCH-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]search-tags\f[] {\f[I]pattern\f[]}
.PP
Searches the tags on all objects in the cluster (the cluster
itself, the nodes and the instances) for a given pattern. The
pattern is interpreted as a regular expression and a search will be
done on it (i.e. the given pattern is not anchored to the beggining
of the string; if you want that, prefix the pattern with ^).
.PP
If no tags are matching the pattern, the exit code of the command
will be one. If there is at least one match, the exit code will be
zero. Each match is listed on one line, the object and the tag
separated by a space. The cluster will be listed as /cluster, a
node will be listed as /nodes/\f[I]name\f[], and an instance as
/instances/\f[I]name\f[].
Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-cluster\ search-tags\ time
      /cluster\ ctime:2007-09-01
      /nodes/node1.example.com\ mtime:2007-10-04
\f[]
.SS VERIFY
.PP
\f[B]verify\f[] [--no-nplus1-mem]
.PP
Verify correctness of cluster configuration. This is safe with
respect to running instances, and incurs no downtime of the
instances.
.PP
If the \f[B]--no-nplus1-mem\f[] option is given, Ganeti won\[aq]t
check whether if it loses a node it can restart all the instances
on their secondaries (and report an error otherwise).
.SS VERIFY-DISKS
.PP
\f[B]verify-disks\f[]
.PP
The command checks which instances have degraded DRBD disks and
activates the disks of those instances.
.PP
This command is run from the \f[B]ganeti-watcher\f[] tool, which
also has a different, complementary algorithm for doing this check.
Together, these two should ensure that DRBD disks are kept
consistent.
