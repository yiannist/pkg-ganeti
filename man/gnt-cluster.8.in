gnt-cluster - Ganeti administration, cluster-wide
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]gnt-cluster\f[] {command} [arguments...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]gnt-cluster\f[] is used for cluster-wide administration in the
Ganeti system.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS ACTIVATE-MASTER-IP
.PP
\f[B]activate-master-ip\f[]
.PP
Activates the master IP on the master node.
.SS COMMAND
.PP
\f[B]command\f[] [-n \f[I]node\f[]] [-g \f[I]group\f[]] [-M]
{\f[I]command\f[]}
.PP
Executes a command on all nodes.
This command is designed for simple usage.
For more complex use cases the commands \f[B]dsh\f[](1) or
\f[B]cssh\f[](1) should be used instead.
.PP
If the option \f[C]-n\f[] is not given, the command will be executed on
all nodes, otherwise it will be executed only on the node(s) specified.
Use the option multiple times for running it on multiple nodes, like:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ gnt-cluster\ command\ -n\ node1.example.com\ -n\ node2.example.com\ date
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[C]-g\f[] option can be used to run a command only on a specific
node group, e.g.:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ gnt-cluster\ command\ -g\ default\ date
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The \f[C]-M\f[] option can be used to prepend the node name to all
output lines.
The \f[C]--failure-only\f[] option hides successful commands, making it
easier to see failures.
.PP
The command is executed serially on the selected nodes.
If the master node is present in the list, the command will be executed
last on the master.
Regarding the other nodes, the execution order is somewhat alphabetic,
so that node2.example.com will be earlier than node10.example.com but
after node1.example.com.
.PP
So given the node names node1, node2, node3, node10, node11, with node3
being the master, the order will be: node1, node2, node10, node11,
node3.
.PP
The command is constructed by concatenating all other command line
arguments.
For example, to list the contents of the /etc directory on all nodes,
run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ gnt-cluster\ command\ ls\ -l\ /etc
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and the command which will be executed will be \f[C]ls\ -l\ /etc\f[].
.SS COPYFILE
.PP
\f[B]copyfile\f[] [--use-replication-network] [-n \f[I]node\f[]] [-g
\f[I]group\f[]]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
{\f[I]file\f[]}
.PP
Copies a file to all or to some nodes.
The argument specifies the source file (on the current system), the
\f[C]-n\f[] argument specifies the target node, or nodes if the option
is given multiple times.
If \f[C]-n\f[] is not given at all, the file will be copied to all
nodes.
The \f[C]-g\f[] option can be used to only select nodes in a specific
node group.
Passing the \f[C]--use-replication-network\f[] option will cause the
copy to be done over the replication network (only matters if the
primary/secondary IPs are different).
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ gnt-cluster\ -n\ node1.example.com\ -n\ node2.example.com\ copyfile\ /tmp/test
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will copy the file /tmp/test from the current node to the two named
nodes.
.SS DEACTIVATE-MASTER-IP
.PP
\f[B]deactivate-master-ip\f[] [--yes]
.PP
Deactivates the master IP on the master node.
.PP
This should be run only locally or on a connection to the node ip
directly, as a connection to the master ip will be broken by this
operation.
Because of this risk it will require user confirmation unless the
\f[C]--yes\f[] option is passed.
.SS DESTROY
.PP
\f[B]destroy\f[] {--yes-do-it}
.PP
Remove all configuration files related to the cluster, so that a
\f[B]gnt-cluster init\f[] can be done again afterwards.
.PP
Since this is a dangerous command, you are required to pass the argument
\f[I]--yes-do-it.\f[]
.SS EPO
.PP
\f[B]epo\f[] [--on] [--groups|--all] [--power-delay] \f[I]arguments\f[]
.PP
Performs an emergency power-off on nodes given as arguments.
If \f[C]--groups\f[] is given, arguments are node groups.
If \f[C]--all\f[] is provided, the whole cluster will be shut down.
.PP
The \f[C]--on\f[] flag recovers the cluster after an emergency
power-off.
When powering on the cluster you can use \f[C]--power-delay\f[] to
define the time in seconds (fractions allowed) waited between powering
on individual nodes.
.PP
Please note that the master node will not be turned down or up
automatically.
It will just be left in a state, where you can manully perform the
shutdown of that one node.
If the master is in the list of affected nodes and this is not a
complete cluster emergency power-off (e.g.
using \f[C]--all\f[]), you\[aq]re required to do a master failover to
another node not affected.
.SS GETMASTER
.PP
\f[B]getmaster\f[]
.PP
Displays the current master node.
.SS INFO
.PP
\f[B]info\f[] [--roman]
.PP
Shows runtime cluster information: cluster name, architecture (32 or 64
bit), master node, node list and instance list.
.PP
Passing the \f[C]--roman\f[] option gnt-cluster info will try to print
its integer fields in a latin friendly way.
This allows further diffusion of Ganeti among ancient cultures.
.SS SHOW-ISPECS-CMD
.PP
\f[B]show-ispecs-cmd\f[]
.PP
Shows the command line that can be used to recreate the cluster with the
same options relative to specs in the instance policies.

{\f[I]clustername\f[]}
.PP
This commands is only run once initially on the first node of the
cluster.
It will initialize the cluster configuration, setup the ssh-keys, start
the daemons on the master node, etc.
in order to have a working one-node cluster.
.PP
Note that the \f[I]clustername\f[] is not any random name.
It has to be resolvable to an IP address using DNS, and it is best if
you give the fully-qualified domain name.
This hostname must resolve to an IP address reserved exclusively for
this purpose, i.e.
not already in use.
.PP
The cluster can run in two modes: single-home or dual-homed.
In the first case, all traffic (both public traffic, inter-node traffic
and data replication traffic) goes over the same interface.
In the dual-homed case, the data replication traffic goes over the
second network.
The \f[C]-s\ (--secondary-ip)\f[] option here marks the cluster as
dual-homed and its parameter represents this node\[aq]s address on the
second network.
If you initialise the cluster with \f[C]-s\f[], all nodes added must
have a secondary IP as well.
.PP
Note that for Ganeti it doesn\[aq]t matter if the secondary network is
actually a separate physical network, or is done using tunneling, etc.
For performance reasons, it\[aq]s recommended to use a separate network,
of course.
.PP
The \f[C]--vg-name\f[] option will let you specify a volume group
different than "xenvg" for Ganeti to use when creating instance disks.
This volume group must have the same name on all nodes.
Once the cluster is initialized this can be altered by using the
\f[B]modify\f[] command.
Note that if the volume group name is modified after the cluster
creation and DRBD support is enabled you might have to manually modify
the metavg as well.
.PP
If you don\[aq]t want to use lvm storage at all use the
\f[C]--enabled-disk-templates\f[] option to restrict the set of enabled
disk templates.
Once the cluster is initialized you can change this setup with the
\f[B]modify\f[] command.
.PP
The \f[C]--master-netdev\f[] option is useful for specifying a different
interface on which the master will activate its IP address.
It\[aq]s important that all nodes have this interface because you\[aq]ll
need it for a master failover.
.PP
The \f[C]--master-netmask\f[] option allows to specify a netmask for the
master IP.
The netmask must be specified as an integer, and will be interpreted as
a CIDR netmask.
The default value is 32 for an IPv4 address and 128 for an IPv6 address.
.PP
The \f[C]--use-external-mip-script\f[] option allows to specify whether
to use an user-supplied master IP address setup script, whose location
is \f[C]@SYSCONFDIR@/ganeti/scripts/master-ip-setup\f[].
If the option value is set to False, the default script (located at
\f[C]@PKGLIBDIR@/tools/master-ip-setup\f[]) will be executed.
.PP
The \f[C]-m\ (--mac-prefix)\f[] option will let you specify a three byte
prefix under which the virtual MAC addresses of your instances will be
generated.
The prefix must be specified in the format \f[C]XX:XX:XX\f[] and the
default is \f[C]aa:00:00\f[].
.PP
The \f[C]--no-etc-hosts\f[] option allows you to initialize the cluster
without modifying the /etc/hosts file.
.PP
The \f[C]--no-ssh-init\f[] option allows you to initialize the cluster
without creating or distributing SSH key pairs.
.PP
The \f[C]--file-storage-dir\f[] and \f[C]--shared-file-storage-dir\f[]
options allow you set the directory to use for storing the instance disk
files when using file storage backend, respectively shared file storage
backend, for instance disks.
Note that the file and shared file storage dir must be an allowed
directory for file storage.
Those directories are specified in the
\f[C]@SYSCONFDIR@/ganeti/file-storage-paths\f[] file.
The file storage directory can also be a subdirectory of an allowed one.
The file storage directory should be present on all nodes.
.PP
The \f[C]--prealloc-wipe-disks\f[] sets a cluster wide configuration
value for wiping disks prior to allocation and size changes
(\f[C]gnt-instance\ grow-disk\f[]).
This increases security on instance level as the instance can\[aq]t
access untouched data from its underlying storage.
.PP
The \f[C]--enabled-hypervisors\f[] option allows you to set the list of
hypervisors that will be enabled for this cluster.
Instance hypervisors can only be chosen from the list of enabled
hypervisors, and the first entry of this list will be used by default.
Currently, the following hypervisors are available:
.TP
.B xen-pvm
Xen PVM hypervisor

.RS
.RE
.PP
Either a single hypervisor name or a comma-separated list of hypervisor
names can be specified.
If this option is not specified, only the xen-pvm hypervisor is enabled
by default.
.PP
The \f[C]-H\ (--hypervisor-parameters)\f[] option allows you to set
default hypervisor specific parameters for the cluster.
The format of this option is the name of the hypervisor, followed by a
colon and a comma-separated list of key=value pairs.
The keys available for each hypervisors are detailed in the
\f[B]gnt-instance\f[](8) man page, in the \f[B]add\f[] command plus the
following parameters which are only configurable globally (at cluster
level):
.TP
.B migration_port
Valid for the Xen PVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
This options specifies the TCP port to use for live-migration.
For Xen, the same port should be configured on all nodes in the
\f[C]@XEN_CONFIG_DIR@/xend-config.sxp\f[] file, under the key
"xend-relocation-port".
.RE
.TP
.B migration_bandwidth
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
This option specifies the maximum bandwidth that KVM will use for
instance live migrations.
The value is in MiB/s.
.PP
This option is only effective with kvm versions >= 78 and qemu-kvm
versions >= 0.10.0.
.RE
.PP
The \f[C]-B\ (--backend-parameters)\f[] option allows you to set the
default backend parameters for the cluster.
The parameter format is a comma-separated list of key=value pairs with
the following supported keys:
.TP
.B vcpus
Number of VCPUs to set for an instance by default, must be an integer,
will be set to 1 if no specified.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B maxmem
Maximum amount of memory to allocate for an instance by default, can be
either an integer or an integer followed by a unit (M for mebibytes and
G for gibibytes are supported), will be set to 128M if not specified.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B minmem
Minimum amount of memory to allocate for an instance by default, can be
either an integer or an integer followed by a unit (M for mebibytes and
G for gibibytes are supported), will be set to 128M if not specified.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B auto_balance
Value of the auto_balance flag for instances to use by default, will be
set to true if not specified.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B always_failover

not set, \f[C]False\f[] is used.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The \f[C]-N\ (--nic-parameters)\f[] option allows you to set the default
network interface parameters for the cluster.
The parameter format is a comma-separated list of key=value pairs with
the following supported keys:
.TP
.B mode
The default NIC mode, one of \f[C]routed\f[], \f[C]bridged\f[] or
\f[C]openvswitch\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B link
In \f[C]bridged\f[] or \f[C]openvswitch\f[] mode the default interface
where to attach NICs.
In \f[C]routed\f[] mode it represents an hypervisor-vif-script dependent
value to allow different instance groups.
For example under the KVM default network script it is interpreted as a
routing table number or name.
Openvswitch support is also hypervisor dependent and currently works for
the default KVM network script.
Under Xen a custom network script must be provided.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The \f[C]-D\ (--disk-parameters)\f[] option allows you to set the
default disk template parameters at cluster level.
The format used for this option is similar to the one use by the
\f[C]-H\f[] option: the disk template name must be specified first,
followed by a colon and by a comma-separated list of key-value pairs.
These parameters can only be specified at cluster and node group level;
the cluster-level parameter are inherited by the node group at the
moment of its creation, and can be further modified at node group level
using the \f[B]gnt-group\f[](8) command.

The option \f[C]--maintain-node-health\f[] allows one to enable/disable
automatic maintenance actions on nodes.
Currently these include automatic shutdown of instances and deactivation
of DRBD devices on offline nodes; in the future it might be extended to
automatic removal of unknown LVM volumes, etc.
Note that this option is only useful if the use of \f[C]ganeti-confd\f[]
was enabled at compilation.
.PP
The \f[C]--uid-pool\f[] option initializes the user-id pool.
The \f[I]user-id pool definition\f[] can contain a list of user-ids
and/or a list of user-id ranges.
The parameter format is a comma-separated list of numeric user-ids or
user-id ranges.
The ranges are defined by a lower and higher boundary, separated by a
dash.
The boundaries are inclusive.
If the \f[C]--uid-pool\f[] option is not supplied, the user-id pool is
initialized to an empty list.
An empty list means that the user-id pool feature is disabled.
.PP
The \f[C]-I\ (--default-iallocator)\f[] option specifies the default
instance allocator.
The instance allocator will be used for operations like instance
creation, instance and node migration, etc.
when no manual override is specified.
If this option is not specified and htools was not enabled at build
time, the default instance allocator will be blank, which means that
relevant operations will require the administrator to manually specify
either an instance allocator, or a set of nodes.
If the option is not specified but htools was enabled, the default
iallocator will be \f[B]hail\f[](1) (assuming it can be found on disk).
The default iallocator can be changed later using the \f[B]modify\f[]
command.
.PP
The \f[C]--primary-ip-version\f[] option specifies the IP version used
for the primary address.
Possible values are 4 and 6 for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively.
This option is used when resolving node names and the cluster name.
.PP
The \f[C]--node-parameters\f[] option allows you to set default node
parameters for the cluster.
Please see \f[B]ganeti\f[](7) for more information about supported
key=value pairs.
.PP
The \f[C]-C\ (--candidate-pool-size)\f[] option specifies the
\f[C]candidate_pool_size\f[] cluster parameter.
This is the number of nodes that the master will try to keep as
master_candidates.
For more details about this role and other node roles, see the
\f[B]ganeti\f[](7).
.PP
The \f[C]--specs-...\f[] and \f[C]--ipolicy-...\f[] options specify the

The format is:
min:\f[I]param\f[]=\f[I]value\f[],.../max:\f[I]param\f[]=\f[I]value\f[],...
and further specifications pairs can be added by using \f[C]//\f[] as a
separator.
The \f[C]--ipolicy-std-specs\f[] option takes a list of parameter/value
pairs.
For both options, \f[I]param\f[] can be:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]cpu-count\f[]: number of VCPUs for an instance
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]disk-count\f[]: number of disk for an instance
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]disk-size\f[]: size of each disk
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]memory-size\f[]: instance memory
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]nic-count\f[]: number of network interface
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]spindle-use\f[]: spindle usage for an instance
.PP
For the \f[C]--specs-...\f[] options, each option can have three values:
\f[C]min\f[], \f[C]max\f[] and \f[C]std\f[], which can also be modified
on group level (except for \f[C]std\f[], which is defined once for the
entire cluster).
Please note, that \f[C]std\f[] values are not the same as defaults set
by \f[C]--beparams\f[], but they are used for the capacity calculations.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--specs-cpu-count\f[] limits the number of VCPUs that can be used
by an instance.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--specs-disk-count\f[] limits the number of disks
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--specs-disk-size\f[] limits the disk size for every disk used
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--specs-mem-size\f[] limits the amount of memory available
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--specs-nic-count\f[] sets limits on the number of NICs used
.PP
The \f[C]--ipolicy-spindle-ratio\f[] option takes a decimal number.
The \f[C]--ipolicy-disk-templates\f[] option takes a comma-separated
list of disk templates.
This list of disk templates must be a subset of the list of cluster-wide
enabled disk templates (which can be set with
\f[C]--enabled-disk-templates\f[]).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--ipolicy-spindle-ratio\f[] limits the instances-spindles ratio
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]--ipolicy-vcpu-ratio\f[] limits the vcpu-cpu ratio
.PP
All the instance policy elements can be overridden at group level.
Group level overrides can be removed by specifying \f[C]default\f[] as
the value of an item.
.PP
The \f[C]--drbd-usermode-helper\f[] option can be used to specify a
usermode helper.
Check that this string is the one used by the DRBD kernel.
.PP
For details about how to use \f[C]--hypervisor-state\f[] and
\f[C]--disk-state\f[] have a look at \f[B]ganeti\f[](7).
.PP
The \f[C]--enabled-disk-templates\f[] option specifies a list of disk
templates that can be used by instances of the cluster.
For the possible values in this list, see \f[B]gnt-instance\f[](8).
Note that in contrast to the list of disk templates in the ipolicy, this
list is a hard restriction.
It is not possible to create instances with disk templates that are not
enabled in the cluster.
It is also not possible to disable a disk template when there are still
instances using it.
The first disk template in the list of enabled disk template is the
default disk template.
It will be used for instance creation, if no disk template is requested
explicitely.
.SS MASTER-FAILOVER
.PP
\f[B]master-failover\f[] [--no-voting] [--yes-do-it]
.PP
Failover the master role to the current node.
.PP
The \f[C]--no-voting\f[] option skips the remote node agreement checks.
This is dangerous, but necessary in some cases (for example failing over
the master role in a 2 node cluster with the original master down).
If the original master then comes up, it won\[aq]t be able to start its
master daemon because it won\[aq]t have enough votes, but so won\[aq]t
the new master, if the master daemon ever needs a restart.
You can pass \f[C]--no-voting\f[] to \f[B]ganeti-masterd\f[] on the new
master to solve this problem, and run \f[B]gnt-cluster redist-conf\f[]
to make sure the cluster is consistent again.
.PP
The option \f[C]--yes-do-it\f[] is used together with
\f[C]--no-voting\f[], for skipping the interactive checks.
This is even more dangerous, and should only be used in conjunction with
other means (e.g.
a HA suite) to confirm that the operation is indeed safe.
.SS MASTER-PING
.PP
\f[B]master-ping\f[]
.PP
Checks if the master daemon is alive.
.PP
If the master daemon is alive and can respond to a basic query (the
equivalent of \f[B]gnt-cluster info\f[]), then the exit code of the
command will be 0.
If the master daemon is not alive (either due to a crash or because this
is not the master node), the exit code will be 1.

.PP
The \f[C]--add-uids\f[] and \f[C]--remove-uids\f[] options can be used
to modify the user-id pool by adding/removing a list of user-ids or
user-id ranges.
.PP
The option \f[C]--reserved-lvs\f[] specifies a list (comma-separated) of
logical volume group names (regular expressions) that will be ignored by
the cluster verify operation.
This is useful if the volume group used for Ganeti is shared with the
system for other uses.
Note that it\[aq]s not recommended to create and mark as ignored logical
volume names which match Ganeti\[aq]s own name format (starting with
UUID and then .diskN), as this option only skips the verification, but
not the actual use of the names given.
.PP
To remove all reserved logical volumes, pass in an empty argument to the
option, as in \f[C]--reserved-lvs=\f[] or
\f[C]--reserved-lvs\ \[aq]\[aq]\f[].

See \f[B]ganeti\f[](7) for a description of \f[C]--submit\f[] and other
common options.
.SS QUEUE
.PP
\f[B]queue\f[] {drain | undrain | info}
.PP
Change job queue properties.
.PP
The \f[C]drain\f[] option sets the drain flag on the job queue.
No new jobs will be accepted, but jobs already in the queue will be
processed.
.PP
The \f[C]undrain\f[] will unset the drain flag on the job queue.
New jobs will be accepted.
.PP
The \f[C]info\f[] option shows the properties of the job queue.
.SS WATCHER
.PP
\f[B]watcher\f[] {pause \f[I]duration\f[] | continue | info}
.PP
Make the watcher pause or let it continue.
.PP
The \f[C]pause\f[] option causes the watcher to pause for
\f[I]duration\f[] seconds.
.PP
The \f[C]continue\f[] option will let the watcher continue.
.PP
The \f[C]info\f[] option shows whether the watcher is currently paused.
.SS REDIST-CONF
.PP
\f[B]redist-conf\f[] [--submit] [--print-job-id]
.PP
This command forces a full push of configuration files from the master
node to the other nodes in the cluster.
This is normally not needed, but can be run if the \f[B]verify\f[]
complains about configuration mismatches.
.PP
See \f[B]ganeti\f[](7) for a description of \f[C]--submit\f[] and other
common options.
.SS RENAME
.PP
\f[B]rename\f[] [-f] {\f[I]name\f[]}
.PP
Renames the cluster and in the process updates the master IP address to
the one the new name resolves to.
At least one of either the name or the IP address must be different,
otherwise the operation will be aborted.
.PP
Note that since this command can be dangerous (especially when run over

This command will stop all Ganeti daemons in the cluster and start them
again once the new certificates and keys are replicated.
The options \f[C]--new-cluster-certificate\f[] and
\f[C]--new-confd-hmac-key\f[] can be used to regenerate respectively the
cluster-internal SSL certificate and the HMAC key used by
\f[B]ganeti-confd\f[](8).
.PP
To generate a new self-signed RAPI certificate (used by
\f[B]ganeti-rapi\f[](8)) specify \f[C]--new-rapi-certificate\f[].
If you want to use your own certificate, e.g.
one signed by a certificate authority (CA), pass its filename to
\f[C]--rapi-certificate\f[].
.PP
To generate a new self-signed SPICE certificate, used for SPICE
connections to the KVM hypervisor, specify the
\f[C]--new-spice-certificate\f[] option.
If you want to provide a certificate, pass its filename to
\f[C]--spice-certificate\f[] and pass the signing CA certificate to
\f[C]--spice-ca-certificate\f[].
.PP
Finally \f[C]--new-cluster-domain-secret\f[] generates a new, random
cluster domain secret, and \f[C]--cluster-domain-secret\f[] reads the
secret from a file.
The cluster domain secret is used to sign information exchanged between
separate clusters via a third party.
.SS REPAIR-DISK-SIZES
.PP
\f[B]repair-disk-sizes\f[] [instance...]
.PP
This command checks that the recorded size of the given instance\[aq]s
disks matches the actual size and updates any mismatches found.
This is needed if the Ganeti configuration is no longer consistent with
reality, as it will impact some disk operations.
If no arguments are given, all instances will be checked.
When exclusive storage is active, also spindles are updated.
.PP
Note that only active disks can be checked by this command; in case a
disk cannot be activated it\[aq]s advised to use \f[B]gnt-instance
activate-disks --ignore-size ...\f[] to force activation without regard
to the current size.
.PP
When all the disk sizes are consistent, the command will return no
output.
Otherwise it will log details about the inconsistencies in the
configuration.
.SS UPGRADE
.PP
\f[B]upgrade\f[] {--to \f[I]version\f[] | --resume}
.PP
This command safely switches all nodes of the cluster to a new Ganeti
version.
It is a prerequisite that the new version is already installed, albeit
not activated, on all nodes; this requisite is checked before any
actions are done.
.PP
If called with the \f[C]--resume\f[] option, any pending upgrade is
continued, that was interrupted by a power failure or similar on master.
It will do nothing, if not run on the master node, or if no upgrade was
in progress.

.PP
If the \f[C]--no-nplus1-mem\f[] option is given, Ganeti won\[aq]t check
whether if it loses a node it can restart all the instances on their
secondaries (and report an error otherwise).
.PP
With \f[C]--node-group\f[], restrict the verification to those nodes and
instances that live in the named group.
This will not verify global settings, but will allow to perform
verification of a group while other operations are ongoing in other
groups.
.PP
The \f[C]--error-codes\f[] option outputs each error in the following
parseable format:

The \f[C]--ignore-errors\f[] option can be used to change this
behaviour, because it demotes the error represented by the error code
received as a parameter to a warning.
The option must be repeated for each error that should be ignored (e.g.:

.PP
Add tags to the cluster.
If any of the tags contains invalid characters, the entire operation
will abort.
.PP
If the \f[C]--from\f[] option is given, the list of tags will be
extended with the contents of that file (each line becomes a tag).
In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the command line (if you
do, both sources will be used).
A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.
.SS LIST-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]list-tags\f[]
.PP

.SS REMOVE-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]remove-tags\f[] [--from \f[I]file\f[]] {\f[I]tag\f[]...}
.PP
Remove tags from the cluster.
If any of the tags are not existing on the cluster, the entire operation
will abort.
.PP
If the \f[C]--from\f[] option is given, the list of tags to be removed
will be extended with the contents of that file (each line becomes a
tag).
In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the command line (if you
do, tags from both sources will be removed).
A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.
.SS SEARCH-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]search-tags\f[] {\f[I]pattern\f[]}
.PP
Searches the tags on all objects in the cluster (the cluster itself, the
nodes and the instances) for a given pattern.
The pattern is interpreted as a regular expression and a search will be
done on it (i.e.
the given pattern is not anchored to the beggining of the string; if you
want that, prefix the pattern with ^).
.PP
If no tags are matching the pattern, the exit code of the command will
be one.
If there is at least one match, the exit code will be zero.
Each match is listed on one line, the object and the tag separated by a
space.
The cluster will be listed as /cluster, a node will be listed as
/nodes/\f[I]name\f[], and an instance as /instances/\f[I]name\f[].
