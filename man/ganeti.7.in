.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Ganeti software manages physical nodes and virtual instances of a
cluster based on a virtualization software.
The current version (2.3) supports Xen 3.x and KVM (72 or above) as
hypervisors, and LXC as an experimental hypervisor.
.SH Quick start
.PP
First you must install the software on all the cluster nodes, either
from sources or (if available) from a package.
The next step is to create the initial cluster configuration, using
\f[B]gnt-cluster init\f[].
.PP
Then you can add other nodes, or start creating instances.
.SH Cluster architecture
.PP
In Ganeti 2.0, the architecture of the cluster is a little more
complicated than in 1.2.
The cluster is coordinated by a master daemon
(\f[B]ganeti-masterd\f[](8)), running on the master node.
Each node runs (as before) a node daemon, and the master has the RAPI
daemon running too.
.SS Node roles
.PP
Each node can be in one of the following states:
.TP
.B master
Only one node per cluster can be in this role, and this node is the one
holding the authoritative copy of the cluster configuration and the one
that can actually execute commands on the cluster and modify the cluster
state.
See more details under \f[I]Cluster configuration\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B master_candidate
The node receives the full cluster configuration (configuration file and
jobs) and can become a master via the \f[B]gnt-cluster
master-failover\f[] command.
Nodes that are not in this state cannot transition into the master role
due to missing state.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B regular
This the normal state of a node.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B drained
Nodes in this state are functioning normally but cannot receive new
instances, because the intention is to set them to \f[I]offline\f[] or
remove them from the cluster.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B offline
These nodes are still recorded in the Ganeti configuration, but except
for the master daemon startup voting procedure, they are not actually
contacted by the master.
This state was added in order to allow broken machines (that are being
repaired) to remain in the cluster but without creating problems.
.RS
.RE
.SS Node flags
.PP
Nodes have two flags which govern which roles they can take:
.TP
.B master_capable
The node can become a master candidate, and furthermore the master node.
When this flag is disabled, the node cannot become a candidate; this can
be useful for special networking cases, or less reliable hardware.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B vm_capable
The node can host instances.
When enabled (the default state), the node will participate in instance
allocation, capacity calculation, etc.
When disabled, the node will be skipped in many cluster checks and
operations.
.RS
.RE
.SS Node Parameters
.PP
The \f[C]ndparams\f[] refer to node parameters.
These can be set as defaults on cluster and node group levels, but they
take effect for nodes only.
.PP
Currently we support the following node parameters:
.TP
.B oob_program
Path to an executable used as the out-of-band helper as described in the
Ganeti Node OOB Management Framework (design-oob.rst) design document.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B spindle_count
This should reflect the I/O performance of local attached storage (e.g.
for "file", "plain" and "drbd" disk templates).
It doesn\[aq]t have to match the actual spindle count of (any eventual)
mechanical hard-drives, its meaning is site-local and just the relative
values matter.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B exclusive_storage
When this Boolean flag is enabled, physical disks on the node are
assigned to instance disks in an exclusive manner, so as to lower I/O
interference between instances.
See the Partitioned Ganeti (design-partitioned.rst) design document for
more details.
This parameter cannot be set on individual nodes, as its value must be
the same within each node group.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B ovs
When this Boolean flag is enabled, OpenvSwitch will be used as the
network layer.
This will cause the initialization of OpenvSwitch on the nodes when
added to the cluster.
Per default this is not enabled.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B ovs_name
When ovs is enabled, this parameter will represent the name of the
OpenvSwitch to generate and use.
This will default to `switch1`.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B ovs_link
When ovs is enabled, a OpenvSwitch will be initialized on new nodes and
will have this as its connection to the outside.
This parameter is not set per default, as it depends very much on the
specific setup.
.RS
.RE
.SS Hypervisor State Parameters
.PP
Using \f[C]--hypervisor-state\f[] you can set hypervisor specific states
as pointed out in
\f[C]Ganeti\ Resource\ Model\ <design-resource-model.rst>\f[].
.PP
The format is: \f[C]hypervisor:option=value\f[].
.PP
Currently we support the following hypervisor state values:
.TP
.B mem_total
Total node memory, as discovered by this hypervisor
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B mem_node
Memory used by, or reserved for, the node itself; note that some
hypervisors can report this in an authoritative way, other not
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B mem_hv
Memory used either by the hypervisor itself or lost due to instance
allocation rounding; usually this cannot be precisely computed, but only
roughly estimated
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B cpu_total
Total node cpu (core) count; usually this can be discovered
automatically
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B cpu_node
Number of cores reserved for the node itself; this can either be
discovered or set manually.
Only used for estimating how many VCPUs are left for instances
.RS
.RE
.PP
Note that currently this option is unused by Ganeti; values will be
recorded but will not influence the Ganeti operation.
.SS Disk State Parameters
.PP
Using \f[C]--disk-state\f[] you can set disk specific states as pointed
out in \f[C]Ganeti\ Resource\ Model\ <design-resource-model.rst>\f[].
.PP
The format is: \f[C]storage_type/identifier:option=value\f[].
Where we currently just support \f[C]lvm\f[] as storage type.
The identifier in this case is the LVM volume group.
By default this is \f[C]xenvg\f[].
.PP
Currently we support the following hypervisor state values:
.TP
.B disk_total
Total disk size (usually discovered automatically)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B disk_reserved
Reserved disk size; this is a lower limit on the free space, if such a
limit is desired
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B disk_overhead
Disk that is expected to be used by other volumes (set via
\f[C]reserved_lvs\f[]); usually should be zero
.RS
.RE
.PP
Note that currently this option is unused by Ganeti; values will be
recorded but will not influence the Ganeti operation.
.SS Cluster configuration
.PP
The master node keeps and is responsible for the cluster configuration.
On the filesystem, this is stored under the
\f[C]@LOCALSTATEDIR@/ganeti/lib\f[] directory, and if the master
daemon is stopped it can be backed up normally.
.PP
The master daemon will replicate the configuration database called
\f[C]config.data\f[] and the job files to all the nodes in the master
candidate role.
It will also distribute a copy of some configuration values via the
\f[I]ssconf\f[] files, which are stored in the same directory and start
with a \f[C]ssconf_\f[] prefix, to all nodes.
.SS Jobs
.PP
All cluster modification are done via jobs.
A job consists of one or more opcodes, and the list of opcodes is
processed serially.
If an opcode fails, the entire job is failed and later opcodes are no
longer processed.
A job can be in one of the following states:
.TP
.B queued
The job has been submitted but not yet processed by the master daemon.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B waiting
The job is waiting for for locks before the first of its opcodes.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B canceling
The job is waiting for locks, but is has been marked for cancellation.
It will not transition to \f[I]running\f[], but to \f[I]canceled\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B running
The job is currently being executed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B canceled
The job has been canceled before starting execution.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B success
The job has finished successfully.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B error
The job has failed during runtime, or the master daemon has been stopped
during the job execution.
.RS
.RE
.SH Common command line features
.SS Options
.PP
Many Ganeti commands provide the following options.
The availability for a certain command can be checked by calling the
command using the \f[C]--help\f[] option.
.PP
\f[B]gnt-...\f[] \f[I]command\f[] [--dry-run] [--priority {low | normal
| high}]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
[--submit] [--print-job-id]
.PP
The \f[C]--dry-run\f[] option can be used to check whether an operation
would succeed.
.PP
The option \f[C]--priority\f[] sets the priority for opcodes submitted
by the command.
.PP
The \f[C]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion.
The job ID will be shown so that it can be examined using \f[B]gnt-job
info\f[].
.PP
The \f[C]--print-job-id\f[] option makes the command print the job id as
first line on stdout, so that it is easy to parse by other programs.
.SS Defaults
.PP
For certain commands you can use environment variables to provide
default command line arguments.
Just assign the arguments as a string to the corresponding environment
variable.
The format of that variable name is \f[B]binary\f[]_\f[I]command\f[].
\f[B]binary\f[] is the name of the \f[C]gnt-*\f[] script all upper case
and dashes replaced by underscores, and \f[I]command\f[] is the command
invoked on that script.
.PP
Currently supported commands are \f[C]gnt-node\ list\f[],
\f[C]gnt-group\ list\f[] and \f[C]gnt-instance\ list\f[].
So you can configure default command line flags by setting
\f[C]GNT_NODE_LIST\f[], \f[C]GNT_GROUP_LIST\f[] and
\f[C]GNT_INSTANCE_LIST\f[].
.SS Debug options
.PP
If the variable \f[C]FORCE_LUXI_SOCKET\f[] is set, it will override the
socket used for LUXI connections by command-line tools (\f[C]gnt-*\f[]).
This is useful mostly for debugging, and some operations won\[aq]t work
at all if, for example, you point this variable to the confd-supplied
query socket and try to submit a job.
.PP
If the variable is set to the value \f[C]master\f[], it will connect to
the correct path for the master daemon (even if, for example, split
queries are enabled and this is a query operation).
If set to \f[C]query\f[], it will always (try to) connect to the query
socket, even if split queries are disabled.
Otherwise, the value is taken to represent a filesystem path to the
socket to use.
.SH Field formatting
.PP
Multiple ganeti commands use the same framework for tabular listing of
resources (e.g.
\f[B]gnt-instance list\f[], \f[B]gnt-node list\f[], \f[B]gnt-group
list\f[], \f[B]gnt-debug locks\f[], etc.)
\&.
For these commands, special states are denoted via a special symbol (in
terse mode) or a string (in verbose mode):
.TP
.B *, (offline)
The node in question is marked offline, and thus it cannot be queried
for data.
This result is persistent until the node is de-offlined.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B ?, (nodata)
Ganeti expected to receive an answer from this entity, but the cluster
RPC call failed and/or we didn\[aq]t receive a valid answer; usually
more information is available in the node daemon log (if the node is
alive) or the master daemon log.
This result is transient, and re-running command might return a
different result.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -, (unavail)
The respective field doesn\[aq]t make sense for this entity; e.g.
querying a down instance for its current memory \[aq]live\[aq] usage, or
querying a non-vm_capable node for disk/memory data.
This result is persistent, and until the entity state is changed via
ganeti commands, the result won\[aq]t change.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B ??, (unknown)
This field is not known (note that this is different from entity being
unknown).
Either you have mis-typed the field name, or you are using a field that
the running Ganeti master daemon doesn\[aq]t know.
This result is persistent, re-running the command won\[aq]t change it.
.RS
.RE
.SS Key-value parameters
.PP
Multiple options take parameters that are of the form
\f[C]key=value,key=value,...\f[] or \f[C]category:key=value,...\f[].
Examples are the hypervisor parameters, backend parameters, etc.
For these, it\[aq]s possible to use values that contain commas by
escaping with via a backslash (which needs two if not single-quoted, due
to shell behaviour):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ gnt-instance\ modify\ -H\ kernel_path=an\\\\,example\ instance1
#\ gnt-instance\ modify\ -H\ kernel_path=\[aq]an\\,example\[aq]\ instance1
\f[]
.fi
.SS Query filters
.PP
Most commands listing resources (e.g.
instances or nodes) support filtering.
The filter language is similar to Python expressions with some elements
from Perl.
The language is not generic.
Each condition must consist of a field name and a value (except for
boolean checks), a field can not be compared to another field.
Keywords are case-sensitive.
.PP
Examples (see below for syntax details):
.IP \[bu] 2
