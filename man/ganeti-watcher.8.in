ganeti-watcher - Ganeti cluster watcher
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]ganeti-watcher\f[] [\f[C]--debug\f[]]
[\f[C]--job-age=\f[]\f[I]age\f[]] [\f[C]--ignore-pause\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]ganeti-watcher\f[] is a periodically run script which is
responsible for keeping the instances in the correct status.
It has two separate functions, one for the master node and another one
that runs on every node.
.PP
If the watcher is disabled at cluster level (via the \f[B]gnt-cluster
watcher pause\f[] command), it will exit without doing anything.
The cluster-level pause can be overridden via the
\f[C]--ignore-pause\f[] option, for example if during a maintenance the
watcher needs to be disabled in general, but the administrator wants to
run it just once.
.PP
The \f[C]--debug\f[] option will increase the verbosity of the watcher
and also activate logging to the standard error.
.SS Master operations
.PP
Its primary function is to try to keep running all instances which are
marked as \f[I]up\f[] in the configuration file, by trying to start them
a limited number of times.
.PP
Another function is to "repair" DRBD links by reactivating the block
devices of instances which have secondaries on nodes that have been
rebooted.
.PP
The watcher will also archive old jobs (older than the age given via the
\f[C]--job-age\f[] option, which defaults to 6 hours), in order to keep
the job queue manageable.
.SS Node operations
.PP
The watcher will restart any down daemons that are appropriate for the
current node.
.PP
In addition, it will execute any scripts which exist under the "watcher"
directory in the Ganeti hooks directory
(\f[C]@SYSCONFDIR@/ganeti/hooks\f[]).
This should be used for lightweight actions, like starting any extra
daemons.
.PP
If the cluster parameter \f[C]maintain_node_health\f[] is enabled, then
the watcher will also shutdown instances and DRBD devices if the node is
declared as offline by known master candidates.
.PP
The watcher does synchronous queries but will submit jobs for executing
the changes.
Due to locking, it could be that the jobs execute much later than the
watcher submits them.
.SH FILES
.PP
The command has a set of state files (one per group) located at
\f[C]@LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/watcher.GROUP-UUID.data\f[] (only used
on the master) and a log file at
\f[C]@LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/ganeti/watcher.log\f[].
Removal of either file(s) will not affect correct operation; the removal
of the state file will just cause the restart counters for the instances
to reset to zero, and mark nodes as freshly rebooted (so for example
DRBD minors will be re-activated).
.PP
In some cases, it\[aq]s even desirable to reset the watcher state, for
example after maintenance actions, or when you want to simulate the
reboot of all nodes, so in this case, you can remove all state files:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rm\ -f\ @LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/watcher.*.data
rm\ -f\ @LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/watcher.*.instance-status
rm\ -f\ @LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/instance-status
\f[]
.fi
.PP
And then re-run the watcher.
