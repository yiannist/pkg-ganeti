.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP

--job-delay = \f[I]seconds\f[] ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Harep is the Ganeti auto-repair tool.
It is able to detect that an instance is broken and to generate a
sequence of jobs that will fix it, in accordance to the policies set by
the administrator.
.PP
Harep is able to recognize what state an instance is in (healthy,
suspended, needs repair, repair disallowed, pending repair, repair
disallowed, repair failed) and to lead it through a sequence of steps
that will bring the instance back to the healthy state.
Therefore, harep is mainly meant to be run regularly and frequently
using a cron job, so that is can actually follow the instance along all
the process.
At every run, harep will update the tags it adds to instances that
describe its repair status, and will submit jobs that actually perform
the required repair operations.
.PP
By default, harep only reports on the health status of instances, but
doesn\[aq]t perform any action, as they might be potentially dangerous.
Therefore, harep will only touch instances that it has been explicitly
authorized to work on.
.PP
The tags enabling harep, can be associated to single instances, or to a
nodegroup or to the whole cluster, therefore affecting all the instances
they contain.
The possible tags share the common structure:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
ganeti:watcher:autorepair:<type>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
where \f[C]<type>\f[] can have the following values:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]fix-storage\f[]: allow disk replacement or fix the backend without
affecting the instance itself (broken DRBD secondary)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]migrate\f[]: allow instance migration
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]failover\f[]: allow instance reboot on the secondary
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]reinstall\f[]: allow disks to be recreated and the instance to be
reinstalled
.PP
Each element in the list of tags, includes all the authorizations of the
previous one, with \f[C]fix-storage\f[] being the least powerful and
\f[C]reinstall\f[] being the most powerful.
.PP
In case multiple autorepair tags act on the same instance, only one can
actually be active.
The conflict is solved according to the following rules:
.IP "1." 3
if multiple tags are in the same object, the least destructive takes
precedence.
.IP "2." 3
if the tags are across objects, the nearest tag wins.
.PP
Example: A cluster has instances I1 and I2, where I1 has the
\f[C]failover\f[] tag, and the cluster has both \f[C]fix-storage\f[] and
\f[C]reinstall\f[].
The I1 instance will be allowed to \f[C]failover\f[], the I2 instance
only to \f[C]fix-storage\f[].
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The options that can be passed to the program are as follows:
.TP
.B -L \f[I]socket\f[], --luxi=\f[I]socket\f[]
collect data via Luxi, optionally using the given \f[I]socket\f[] path.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B --job-delay=\f[I]seconds\f[]
insert this much delay before the execution of repair jobs to allow the
tool to continue processing instances.
.RS
.RE
