.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hinfo is the cluster information printer.
It prints information about the current cluster state and its residing
nodes/instances.
It\[aq]s similar to the output of \f[B]hbal\f[] except that it
doesn\[aq]t take any action is just for information purpose.
This information might be useful for debugging a certain cluster state.
.SH OPTIONS
