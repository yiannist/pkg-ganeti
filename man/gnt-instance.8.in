.PP
Creates a new instance on the specified host. The \f[I]instance\f[]
argument must be in DNS, but depending on the bridge/routing setup,
need not be in the same network as the nodes in the cluster.
.PP
The \f[B]disk\f[] option specifies the parameters for the disks of
the instance. The numbering of disks starts at zero, and at least
one disk needs to be passed. For each disk, either the size or the
adoption source needs to be given, and optionally the access mode
(read-only or the default of read-write) and LVM volume group can
also be specified. The size is interpreted (when no unit is given)
in mebibytes. You can also use one of the suffixes \f[I]m\f[],
\f[I]g\f[] or \f[I]t\f[] to specify the exact the units used; these
suffixes map to mebibytes, gibibytes and tebibytes.
.PP
When using the \f[B]adopt\f[] key in the disk definition, Ganeti
will reuse those volumes (instead of creating new ones) as the
instance\[aq]s disks. Ganeti will rename these volumes to the
standard format, and (without installing the OS) will use them
as-is for the instance. This allows migrating instances from
non-managed mode (e.q. plain KVM with LVM) to being managed via
Ganeti. Note that this works only for the `plain\[aq] disk template
(see below for template details).
.PP
Alternatively, a single-disk instance can be created via the
\f[B]-s\f[] option which takes a single argument, the size of the
disk. This is similar to the Ganeti 1.2 version (but will only
create one disk).
.PP
The minimum disk specification is therefore
\f[B]--disk\ 0:size=20G\f[] (or \f[B]-s\ 20G\f[] when using the
\f[B]-s\f[] option), and a three-disk instance can be specified as
\f[B]--disk\ 0:size=20G\ --disk\ 1:size=4G\ --disk\ 2:size=100G\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]--no-ip-check\f[] skips the checks that are done to see if
the instance\[aq]s IP is not already alive (i.e. reachable from the
master node).
.PP
The \f[B]--no-name-check\f[] skips the check for the instance name
via the resolver (e.g. in DNS or /etc/hosts, depending on your
setup). Since the name check is used to compute the IP address, if
you pass this option you must also pass the \f[B]--no-ip-check\f[]
option.
.PP
If you don\[aq]t wat the instance to automatically start after
creation, this is possible via the \f[B]--no-start\f[] option. This
will leave the instance down until a subsequent
\f[B]gnt-instance start\f[] command.
.PP
The NICs of the instances can be specified via the \f[B]--net\f[]
option. By default, one NIC is created for the instance, with a
random MAC, and set up according the the cluster level nic
parameters. Each NIC can take these parameters (all optional):
.TP
.B mac
either a value or \[aq]generate\[aq] to generate a new unique MAC
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B ip
specifies the IP address assigned to the instance from the Ganeti
side (this is not necessarily what the instance will use, but what
the node expects the instance to use)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B mode
specifies the connection mode for this nic: routed or bridged.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B link
in bridged mode specifies the bridge to attach this NIC to, in
routed mode it\[aq]s intended to differentiate between different
routing tables/instance groups (but the meaning is dependent on the
network script, see gnt-cluster(8) for more details)
.RS
.RE
.PP
Of these "mode" and "link" are nic parameters, and inherit their
default at cluster level. Alternatively, if no network is desired
for the instance, you can prevent the default of one NIC with the
\f[B]--no-nics\f[] option.
.PP
The \f[B]-o\f[] options specifies the operating system to be
installed. The available operating systems can be listed with
\f[B]gnt-os list\f[].
Passing \f[B]--no-install\f[] will however skip the OS
installation, allowing a manual import if so desired. Note that the
no-installation mode will automatically disable the start-up of the
instance (without an OS, it most likely won\[aq]t be able to
start-up successfully).
.PP
The \f[B]-B\f[] option specifies the backend parameters for the
instance. If no such parameters are specified, the values are
inherited from the cluster. Possible parameters are:
.TP
.B memory
the memory size of the instance; as usual, suffixes can be used to
denote the unit, otherwise the value is taken in mebibites
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B vcpus
the number of VCPUs to assign to the instance (if this value makes
sense for the hypervisor)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B auto_balance
whether the instance is considered in the N+1 cluster checks
(enough redundancy in the cluster to survive a node failure)
.RS
.RE
.PP
The \f[B]-H\f[] option specified the hypervisor to use for the
instance (must be one of the enabled hypervisors on the cluster)
and optionally custom parameters for this instance. If not other
options are used (i.e. the invocation is just -H \f[I]NAME\f[]) the
instance will inherit the cluster options. The defaults below show
the cluster defaults at cluster creation time.
.PP
The possible hypervisor options are as follows:
.TP
.B boot_order
Valid for the Xen HVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
A string value denoting the boot order. This has different meaning
for the Xen HVM hypervisor and for the KVM one.
.PP
For Xen HVM, The boot order is a string of letters listing the boot
devices, with valid device letters being:
.TP
.B a
floppy drive
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B c
hard disk
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B d
CDROM drive
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B n
network boot (PXE)
.RS
.RE
.PP
The default is not to set an HVM boot order which is interpreted as
\[aq]dc\[aq].
.PP
For KVM the boot order is either "cdrom", "disk" or "network".
Please note that older versions of KVM couldn\[aq]t netboot from
virtio interfaces. This has been fixed in more recent versions and
is confirmed to work at least with qemu-kvm 0.11.1.
.RE
.TP
.B blockdev_prefix
Valid for the Xen HVM and PVM hypervisors.
.RS

.B vnc_bind_address
Valid for the Xen HVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
Specifies the address that the VNC listener for this instance
should bind to. Valid values are IPv4 addresses. Use the address
0.0.0.0 to bind to all available interfaces (this is the default)
or specify the address of one of the interfaces on the node to
restrict listening to that interface.
.RE
.TP
.B vnc_tls
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
A boolean option that controls whether the VNC connection is
secured with TLS.

A boolean option that specifies if the hypervisor should enable
ACPI support for this instance. By default, ACPI is disabled.
.RE
.TP
.B pae
Valid for the Xen HVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
A boolean option that specifies if the hypervisor should enabled
PAE support for this instance. The default is false, disabling PAE
support.
.RE
.TP
.B use_localtime
Valid for the Xen HVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
A boolean option that specifies if the instance should be started
with its clock set to the localtime of the machine (when true) or
to the UTC (When false). The default is false, which is useful for
Linux/Unix machines; for Windows OSes, it is recommended to enable
this parameter.
.RE
.TP
.B kernel_path
Valid for the Xen PVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
This option specifies the path (on the node) to the kernel to boot
the instance with. Xen PVM instances always require this, while for
KVM if this option is empty, it will cause the machine to load the
kernel from its disks.
.RE
.TP
.B kernel_args
Valid for the Xen PVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
This options specifies extra arguments to the kernel that will be
loaded. device. This is always used for Xen PVM, while for KVM it
is only used if the \f[B]kernel_path\f[] option is also specified.
.PP
The default setting for this value is simply \f[B]"ro"\f[], which
mounts the root disk (initially) in read-only one. For example,
setting this to single will cause the instance to start in
single-user mode.
.RE
.TP
.B initrd_path
Valid for the Xen PVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
This option specifies the path (on the node) to the initrd to boot
the instance with. Xen PVM instances can use this always, while for
KVM if this option is only used if the \f[B]kernel_path\f[] option
is also specified. You can pass here either an absolute filename
(the path to the initrd) if you want to use an initrd, or use the
format no_initrd_path for no initrd.
.RE
.TP
.B root_path
Valid for the Xen PVM and KVM hypervisors.
.RS
.PP
This options specifies the name of the root device. This is always
needed for Xen PVM, while for KVM it is only used if the
\f[B]kernel_path\f[] option is also specified.

The disk cache mode. It can be either default to not pass any cache
option to KVM, or one of the KVM cache modes: none (for direct
I/O), writethrough (to use the host cache but report completion to
the guest only when the host has committed the changes to disk) or
writeback (to use the host cache and report completion as soon as
the data is in the host cache). Note that there are special
considerations for the cache mode depending on version of KVM used
and disk type (always raw file under Ganeti), please refer to the
KVM documentation for more details.
.RE
.TP
.B security_model
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
The security model for kvm. Currently one of "none", "user" or
"pool". Under "none", the default, nothing is done and instances
are run as the Ganeti daemon user (normally root).
.PP
Under "user" kvm will drop privileges and become the user specified
by the security_domain parameter.
.PP
Under "pool" a global cluster pool of users will be used, making
sure no two instances share the same user on the same node. (this
mode is not implemented yet)
.RE
.TP
.B security_domain
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
Under security model "user" the username to run the instance under.
It must be a valid username existing on the host.
.PP
Cannot be set under security model "none" or "pool".
.RE
.TP
.B kvm_flag
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
If "enabled" the -enable-kvm flag is passed to kvm. If "disabled"
-disable-kvm is passed. If unset no flag is passed, and the default
running mode for your kvm binary will be used.
.RE
.TP
.B mem_path
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
This option passes the -mem-path argument to kvm with the path (on
the node) to the mount point of the hugetlbfs file system, along
with the -mem-prealloc argument too.
.RE
.TP
.B use_chroot
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
This boolean option determines wether to run the KVM instance in a
chroot directory.
.PP
If it is set to \f[B]true\f[], an empty directory is created before
starting the instance and its path is passed via the -chroot flag
to kvm. The directory is removed when the instance is stopped.
.PP
It is set to \f[B]false\f[] by default.
.RE
.TP
.B migration_downtime
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
The maximum amount of time (in ms) a KVM instance is allowed to be
frozen during a live migration, in order to copy dirty memory
pages. Default value is 30ms, but you may need to increase this
value for busy instances.
.PP
This option is only effective with kvm versions >= 87 and qemu-kvm
versions >= 0.11.0.
.RE
.TP
.B cpu_mask
Valid for the LXC hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
The processes belonging to the given instance are only scheduled on
the specified CPUs.
.PP
The parameter format is a comma-separated list of CPU IDs or CPU ID
ranges. The ranges are defined by a lower and higher boundary,
separated by a dash. The boundaries are inclusive.
.RE
.TP
.B usb_mouse
Valid for the KVM hypervisor.
.RS
.PP
This option specifies the usb mouse type to be used. It can be
"mouse" or "tablet". When using VNC it\[aq]s recommended to set it
to "tablet".
.RE
.PP
The \f[B]-O\f[] (\f[B]--os-parameters\f[]) option allows
customisation of the OS parameters. The actual parameter names and
values depends on the OS being used, but the syntax is the same
key=value. For example, setting a hypothetical \f[B]dhcp\f[]
parameter to yes can be achieved by:
.PP
\f[CR]
      gnt-instance\ add\ -O\ dhcp=yes\ ...
\f[]
.PP
The \f[B]--iallocator\f[] option specifies the instance allocator
plugin to use. If you pass in this option the allocator will select
nodes for this instance automatically, so you don\[aq]t need to
pass them with the \f[B]-n\f[] option. For more information please
refer to the instance allocator documentation.
.PP
The \f[B]-t\f[] options specifies the disk layout type for the
instance. The available choices are:
.TP
.B diskless
This creates an instance with no disks. Its useful for testing only
(or other special cases).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B file
Disk devices will be regular files.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B plain
Disk devices will be logical volumes.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B drbd
Disk devices will be drbd (version 8.x) on top of lvm volumes.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The optional second value of the \f[B]--node\f[] is used for the
drbd template type and specifies the remote node.
.PP
If you do not want gnt-instance to wait for the disk mirror to be
synced, use the \f[B]--no-wait-for-sync\f[] option.
.PP
The \f[B]--file-storage-dir\f[] specifies the relative path under
the cluster-wide file storage directory to store file-based disks.
It is useful for having different subdirectories for different
instances. The full path of the directory where the disk files are
stored will consist of cluster-wide file storage directory +
optional subdirectory + instance name. Example:
\f[B]@RPL_FILE_STORAGE_DIR@\f[]\f[I]/mysubdir/instance1.example.com\f[].
This option is only relevant for instances using the file storage
backend.
.PP
The \f[B]--file-driver\f[] specifies the driver to use for
file-based disks. Note that currently these drivers work with the
xen hypervisor only. This option is only relevant for instances
using the file storage backend. The available choices are:
.TP
.B loop
Kernel loopback driver. This driver uses loopback devices to access
the filesystem within the file. However, running I/O intensive
applications in your instance using the loop driver might result in
slowdowns. Furthermore, if you use the loopback driver consider
increasing the maximum amount of loopback devices (on most systems
it\[aq]s 8) using the max_loop param.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B blktap
The blktap driver (for Xen hypervisors). In order to be able to use
the blktap driver you should check if the \[aq]blktapctrl\[aq] user
space disk agent is running (usually automatically started via
xend). This user-level disk I/O interface has the advantage of
better performance. Especially if you use a network file system
(e.g. NFS) to store your instances this is the recommended choice.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so
that it can be examined via \f[B]gnt-job info\f[].
.PP
Example:
.PP
\f[CR]

.SS REMOVE
.PP
\f[B]remove\f[] [--ignore-failures] [--shutdown-timeout=\f[I]N\f[]]
[--submit] {\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Remove an instance. This will remove all data from the instance and
there is \f[I]no way back\f[].
If you are not sure if you use an instance again, use
\f[B]shutdown\f[] first and leave it in the shutdown state for a
while.
.PP
The \f[B]--ignore-failures\f[] option will cause the removal to
proceed even in the presence of errors during the removal of the
instance (e.g. during the shutdown or the disk removal). If this
option is not given, the command will stop at the first error.
.PP
The \f[B]--shutdown-timeout\f[] is used to specify how much time to
wait before forcing the shutdown (e.g. \f[B]xm\ destroy\f[] in Xen,
killing the kvm process for KVM, etc.). By default two minutes are
given to each instance to stop.
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master

formatted in the most appropriate unit. If the \f[B]--separator\f[]
option is given, then the values are shown in mebibytes to allow
parsing by scripts. In both cases, the \f[B]--units\f[] option can
be used to enforce a given output unit.

If the value of the option starts with the character \f[B]+\f[],
the new field(s) will be added to the default list. This allows to
quickly see the default list plus a few other fields, instead of
retyping the entire list of fields.
.PP
There is a subtle grouping about the available output fields: all
fields except for \f[B]oper_state\f[], \f[B]oper_ram\f[],
\f[B]oper_vcpus\f[] and \f[B]status\f[] are configuration value and
not run-time values. So if you don\[aq]t select any of the these
fields, the query will be satisfied instantly from the cluster
configuration, without having to ask the remote nodes for the data.
This can be helpful for big clusters when you only want some data
and it makes sense to specify a reduced set of output fields.
.PP
The default output field list is: name, os, pnode, admin_state,
oper_state, oper_ram.

Modifies the memory size, number of vcpus, ip address, MAC address
and/or nic parameters for an instance. It can also add and remove
disks and NICs to/from the instance. Note that you need to give at
least one of the arguments, otherwise the command complains.
.PP
The \f[B]-H\f[], \f[B]-B\f[] and \f[B]-O\f[] options specifies
hypervisor, backend and OS parameter options in the form of
name=value[,...]. For details which options can be specified, see
the \f[B]add\f[] command.
.PP
The \f[B]-t\f[] option will change the disk template of the
instance. Currently only conversions between the plain and drbd
disk templates are supported, and the instance must be stopped
before attempting the conversion. When changing from the plain to
the drbd disk template, a new secondary node must be specified via
the \f[B]-n\f[] option.
.PP
The \f[B]--disk\ add:size=\f[]\f[I]SIZE\f[] option adds a disk to
the instance. The optional \f[B]vg=\f[]\f[I]VG\f[] option specifies
LVM volume group other than default vg to create disk on. The
\f[B]--disk\ remove\f[] option will remove the last disk of the
instance. The \f[B]--disk\f[]
\f[I]N\f[]\f[B]:mode=\f[]\f[I]MODE\f[] option will change the mode
of the Nth disk of the instance between read-only (\f[B]ro\f[]) and
read-write (\f[B]rw\f[]).
.PP
The \f[B]--net\ add:\f[]\f[I]options\f[] option will add a new NIC
to the instance. The available options are the same as in the
\f[B]add\f[] command (mac, ip, link, mode). The
\f[B]--net\ remove\f[] will remove the last NIC of the instance,
while the \f[B]--net\f[] \f[I]N\f[]:\f[I]options\f[] option will
change the parameters of the Nth instance NIC.
.PP
The option \f[B]--os-type\f[] will change the OS name for the
instance (without reinstallation). In case an OS variant is
specified that is not found, then by default the modification is
refused, unless \f[B]--force-variant\f[] is passed. An invalid OS
will also be refused, unless the \f[B]--force\f[] option is given.
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so

Reinstalls the operating system on the given instance(s). The
instance(s) must be stopped when running this command. If the
\f[B]--os-type\f[] is specified, the operating system is changed.
.PP
The \f[B]--select-os\f[] option switches to an interactive OS
reinstall. The user is prompted to select the OS template from the
list of available OS templates. OS parameters can be overridden
using \f[B]-O\f[] (more documentation for this option under the
\f[B]add\f[] command).
.PP
Since this is a potentially dangerous command, the user will be
required to confirm this action, unless the \f[B]-f\f[] flag is
passed. When multiple instances are selected (either by passing
multiple arguments or by using the \f[B]--node\f[],
\f[B]--primary\f[], \f[B]--secondary\f[] or \f[B]--all\f[]
options), the user must pass the \f[B]--force-multiple\f[] options
to skip the interactive confirmation.

Renames the given instance. The instance must be stopped when
running this command. The requirements for the new name are the
same as for adding an instance: the new name must be resolvable and
the IP it resolves to must not be reachable (in order to prevent
duplicate IPs the next time the instance is started). The IP test
can be skipped if the \f[B]--no-ip-check\f[] option is passed.
.PP
The \f[B]--no-name-check\f[] skips the check for the new instance
name via the resolver (e.g. in DNS or /etc/hosts, depending on your
setup). Since the name check is used to compute the IP address, if
you pass this option you must also pass the \f[B]--no-ip-check\f[]
option.

Note that although you can pass more than one selection option, the
last one wins, so in order to guarantee the desired result,
don\[aq]t pass more than one such option.
.PP
Use \f[B]--force\f[] to start even if secondary disks are failing.
\f[B]--ignore-offline\f[] can be used to ignore offline primary
nodes and mark the instance as started even if the primary is not
available.
.PP
The \f[B]--force-multiple\f[] will skip the interactive
confirmation in the case the more than one instance will be
affected.
.PP
The \f[B]-H\f[] and \f[B]-B\f[] options specify temporary
hypervisor and backend parameters that can be used to start an
instance with modified parameters. They can be useful for quick
testing without having to modify an instance back and forth, e.g.:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-instance\ start\ -H\ root_args="single"\ instance1
      #\ gnt-instance\ start\ -B\ memory=2048\ instance2
\f[]
.PP
The first form will start the instance instance1 in single-user
mode, and the instance instance2 with 2GB of RAM (this time only,
unless that is the actual instance memory size already). Note that
the values override the instance parameters (and not extend them):
an instance with "root_args=ro" when started with -H
root_args=single will result in "single", not "ro single". The
\f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so
that it can be examined via \f[B]gnt-job info\f[].

Stops one or more instances. If the instance cannot be cleanly
stopped during a hardcoded interval (currently 2 minutes), it will
forcibly stop the instance (equivalent to switching off the power
on a physical machine).
.PP
The \f[B]--timeout\f[] is used to specify how much time to wait
before forcing the shutdown (e.g. \f[B]xm\ destroy\f[] in Xen,
killing the kvm process for KVM, etc.). By default two minutes are

Reboots one or more instances. The type of reboot depends on the
value of \f[B]--type\f[].
A soft reboot does a hypervisor reboot, a hard reboot does a
instance stop, recreates the hypervisor config for the instance and
starts the instance. A full reboot does the equivalent of
\f[B]gnt-instance shutdown && gnt-instance startup\f[].
The default is hard reboot.
.PP
For the hard reboot the option \f[B]--ignore-secondaries\f[]

.PP
This command is a generalized form for replacing disks. It is
currently only valid for the mirrored (DRBD) disk template.
.PP
The first form (when passing the \f[B]-p\f[] option) will replace
the disks on the primary, while the second form (when passing the
\f[B]-s\f[] option will replace the disks on the secondary node.
For these two cases (as the node doesn\[aq]t change), it is
possible to only run the replace for a subset of the disks, using
the option \f[B]--disks\f[] which takes a list of comma-delimited
disk indices (zero-based), e.g. 0,2 to replace only the first and
third disks.
.PP
The third form (when passing either the \f[B]--iallocator\f[] or
the \f[B]--new-secondary\f[] option) is designed to change
secondary node of the instance. Specifying \f[B]--iallocator\f[]
makes the new secondary be selected automatically by the specified
allocator plugin, otherwise the new secondary node will be the one
chosen manually via the \f[B]--new-secondary\f[] option.
.PP
The fourth form (when using \f[B]--auto\f[]) will automatically
determine which disks of an instance are faulty and replace them
within the same node. The \f[B]--auto\f[] option works only when an
instance has only faulty disks on either the primary or secondary
node; it doesn\[aq]t work when both sides have faulty disks.
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so
that it can be examined via \f[B]gnt-job info\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]--early-release\f[] changes the code so that the old
storage on secondary node(s) is removed early (before the resync is
completed) and the internal Ganeti locks for the current (and new,
if any) secondary node are also released, thus allowing more
parallelism in the cluster operation. This should be used only when
recovering from a disk failure on the current secondary (thus the
old storage is already broken) or when the storage on the primary
node is known to be fine (thus we won\[aq]t need the old storage
for potential recovery).
.PP
Note that it is not possible to select an offline or drained node
as a new secondary.

{\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Activates the block devices of the given instance. If successful,
the command will show the location and name of the block devices:
.PP
\f[CR]
      node1.example.com:disk/0:/dev/drbd0
      node1.example.com:disk/1:/dev/drbd1
\f[]
.PP
In this example, \f[I]node1.example.com\f[] is the name of the node
on which the devices have been activated. The \f[I]disk/0\f[] and
\f[I]disk/1\f[] are the Ganeti-names of the instance disks; how
they are visible inside the instance is hypervisor-specific.
\f[I]/dev/drbd0\f[] and \f[I]/dev/drbd1\f[] are the actual block
devices as visible on the node. The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is
used to send the job to the master daemon but not wait for its
completion. The job ID will be shown so that it can be examined via
\f[B]gnt-job info\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]--ignore-size\f[] option can be used to activate disks
ignoring the currently configured size in Ganeti. This can be used
in cases where the configuration has gotten out of sync with the
real-world (e.g. after a partially-failed grow-disk operation or
due to rounding in LVM devices). This should not be used in normal
cases, but only when activate-disks fails without it.
.PP
Note that it is safe to run this command while the instance is
already running.
.SS DEACTIVATE-DISKS
.PP
\f[B]deactivate-disks\f[] [-f] [--submit] {\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
De-activates the block devices of the given instance. Note that if
you run this command for an instance with a drbd disk template,
while it is running, it will not be able to shutdown the block
devices on the primary node, but it will shutdown the block devices
on the secondary nodes, thus breaking the replication.
.PP
The \f[B]-f\f[]/\f[B]--force\f[] option will skip checks that the
instance is down; in case the hypervisor is confused and we
can\[aq]t talk to it, normally Ganeti will refuse to deactivate the
disks, but with this option passed it will skip this check and
directly try to deactivate the disks. This can still fail due to
the instance actually running or other issues.
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so
that it can be examined via \f[B]gnt-job info\f[].
.SS GROW-DISK
.PP
\f[B]grow-disk\f[] [--no-wait-for-sync] [--submit]
{\f[I]instance\f[]} {\f[I]disk\f[]} {\f[I]amount\f[]}
.PP
Grows an instance\[aq]s disk. This is only possible for instances
having a plain or drbd disk template.
.PP
Note that this command only change the block device size; it will
not grow the actual filesystems, partitions, etc. that live on that
disk. Usually, you will need to:
.IP "1." 3
use \f[B]gnt-instance grow-disk\f[]
.IP "2." 3
reboot the instance (later, at a convenient time)
.IP "3." 3
use a filesystem resizer, such as ext2online(8) or xfs_growfs(8) to
resize the filesystem, or use fdisk(8) to change the partition
table on the disk
.PP
The \f[I]disk\f[] argument is the index of the instance disk to
grow. The \f[I]amount\f[] argument is given either as a number (and
it represents the amount to increase the disk with in mebibytes) or
can be given similar to the arguments in the create instance
operation, with a suffix denoting the unit.
.PP
Note that the disk grow operation might complete on one node but
fail on the other; this will leave the instance with
different-sized LVs on the two nodes, but this will not create
problems (except for unused space).
.PP
If you do not want gnt-instance to wait for the new disk region to
be synced, use the \f[B]--no-wait-for-sync\f[] option.
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so
that it can be examined via \f[B]gnt-job info\f[].
.PP
Example (increase the first disk for instance1 by 16GiB):
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-instance\ grow-disk\ instance1.example.com\ 0\ 16g
\f[]
.PP
Also note that disk shrinking is not supported; use
\f[B]gnt-backup export\f[] and then \f[B]gnt-backup import\f[] to
reduce the disk size of an instance.
.SS RECREATE-DISKS
.PP
\f[B]recreate-disks\f[] [--submit] [--disks=\f[B]indices\f[]]
{\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Recreates the disks of the given instance, or only a subset of the
disks (if the option \f[B]disks\f[] is passed, which must be a
comma-separated list of disk indices, starting from zero).
.PP
Note that this functionality should only be used for missing disks;
if any of the given disks already exists, the operation will fail.
While this is suboptimal, recreate-disks should hopefully not be
needed in normal operation and as such the impact of this is low.
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so
that it can be examined via \f[B]gnt-job info\f[].
.SS Recovery
.SS FAILOVER
.PP
\f[B]failover\f[] [-f] [--ignore-consistency]
[--shutdown-timeout=\f[I]N\f[]] [--submit] {\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Failover will fail the instance over its secondary node. This works
only for instances having a drbd disk template.
.PP
Normally the failover will check the consistency of the disks
before failing over the instance. If you are trying to migrate
instances off a dead node, this will fail. Use the
\f[B]--ignore-consistency\f[] option for this purpose. Note that
this option can be dangerous as errors in shutting down the
instance will be ignored, resulting in possibly having the instance
running on two machines in parallel (on disconnected DRBD drives).
.PP
The \f[B]--shutdown-timeout\f[] is used to specify how much time to
wait before forcing the shutdown (xm destroy in xen, killing the
kvm process, for kvm). By default two minutes are given to each
instance to stop.
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so
that it can be examined via \f[B]gnt-job info\f[].
.PP
Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-instance\ failover\ instance1.example.com
\f[]
.SS MIGRATE
.PP
\f[B]migrate\f[] [-f] {--cleanup} {\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
\f[B]migrate\f[] [-f] [--non-live] [--migration-mode=live|non-live]
{\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Migrate will move the instance to its secondary node without
shutdown. It only works for instances having the drbd8 disk
template type.
.PP
The migration command needs a perfectly healthy instance, as we
rely on the dual-master capability of drbd8 and the disks of the
instance are not allowed to be degraded.
.PP
The \f[B]--non-live\f[] and \f[B]--migration-mode=non-live\f[]
options will switch (for the hypervisors that support it) between a
"fully live" (i.e. the interruption is as minimal as possible)
migration and one in which the instance is frozen, its state saved
and transported to the remote node, and then resumed there. This
all depends on the hypervisor support for two different methods. In
any case, it is not an error to pass this parameter (it will just
be ignored if the hypervisor doesn\[aq]t support it). The option
\f[B]--migration-mode=live\f[] option will request a fully-live
migration. The default, when neither option is passed, depends on
the hypervisor parameters (and can be viewed with the
\f[B]gnt-cluster info\f[] command).
.PP
If the \f[B]--cleanup\f[] option is passed, the operation changes
from migration to attempting recovery from a failed previous
migration. In this mode, Ganeti checks if the instance runs on the
correct node (and updates its configuration if not) and ensures the
instances\[aq]s disks are configured correctly. In this mode, the
\f[B]--non-live\f[] option is ignored.
.PP
The option \f[B]-f\f[] will skip the prompting for confirmation.
.PP
Example (and expected output):
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-instance\ migrate\ instance1
      Migrate\ will\ happen\ to\ the\ instance\ instance1.\ Note\ that\ migration\ is

.SS MOVE
.PP
\f[B]move\f[] [-f] [-n \f[I]node\f[]]
[--shutdown-timeout=\f[I]N\f[]] [--submit] {\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Move will move the instance to an arbitrary node in the cluster.
This works only for instances having a plain or file disk template.
.PP
Note that since this operation is done via data copy, it will take
a long time for big disks (similar to replace-disks for a drbd
instance).
.PP
The \f[B]--shutdown-timeout\f[] is used to specify how much time to
wait before forcing the shutdown (e.g. \f[B]xm\ destroy\f[] in XEN,
killing the kvm process for KVM, etc.). By default two minutes are
given to each instance to stop.
.PP
The \f[B]--submit\f[] option is used to send the job to the master
daemon but not wait for its completion. The job ID will be shown so
that it can be examined via \f[B]gnt-job info\f[].
.PP
Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-instance\ move\ -n\ node3.example.com\ instance1.example.com

.SS TAGS
.SS ADD-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]add-tags\f[] [--from \f[I]file\f[]] {\f[I]instancename\f[]}
{\f[I]tag\f[]...}
.PP
Add tags to the given instance. If any of the tags contains invalid
characters, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \f[B]--from\f[] option is given, the list of tags will be
extended with the contents of that file (each line becomes a tag).
In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the command line
(if you do, both sources will be used). A file name of - will be
interpreted as stdin.
.SS LIST-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]list-tags\f[] {\f[I]instancename\f[]}
.PP
List the tags of the given instance.
.SS REMOVE-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]remove-tags\f[] [--from \f[I]file\f[]] {\f[I]instancename\f[]}
{\f[I]tag\f[]...}
.PP
Remove tags from the given instance. If any of the tags are not
existing on the node, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \f[B]--from\f[] option is given, the list of tags to be
removed will be extended with the contents of that file (each line
becomes a tag). In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the
command line (if you do, tags from both sources will be removed). A
file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.
