    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
      The <command>&dhpackage;</command> is a periodically run script
      which is responsible for keeping the instances in the correct
      status. It has two separate functions, one for the master node
      and another one that runs on every node.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the watcher is disabled at cluster level (via
      the <command>gnt-cluster watcher pause</command> command), it
      will exit without doing anything. The cluster-level pause can be
      overriden via the <option>--ignore-pause</option> option, for
      example if during a maintenance the watcher needs to be disabled
      in general, but the administrator wants to run it just once.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <option>--debug</option> option will increase the verbosity
      of the watcher and also activate logging to the standard error.
    </para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Master operations</title>

      <para>
        Its primary function is to try to keep running all instances
        which are marked as <emphasis>up</emphasis> in the configuration
        file, by trying to start them a limited number of times.
      </para>

      <para>
        Another function is to <quote>repair</quote> DRBD links by
        reactivating the block devices of instances which have
        secondaries on nodes that have been rebooted.
      </para>

      <para>
        The watcher will also archive old jobs (older than the age
        given via the <option>--job-age</option> option, which
        defaults to 6 hours), in order to keep the job queue
        manageable.
      </para>

    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>

      <title>Node operations</title>

      <para>
        The watcher will restart any down daemons that are appropriate
        for the current node.
      </para>

      <para>
        In addition, it will execute any scripts which exist under the
        <quote>watcher</quote> directory in the Ganeti hooks directory
        (@SYSCONFDIR@/ganeti/hooks). This should be used for
        lightweight actions, like starting any extra daemons.
      </para>

      <para>
        If the cluster
        parameter <literal>maintain_node_health</literal> is enabled,
        then the watcher will also shutdown instances and DRBD devices
        if the node is declared as offline by known master candidates.
      </para>

      <para>
        The watcher does synchronous queries but will submit jobs for
        executing the changes. Due to locking, it could be that the jobs
        execute much later than the watcher submits them.
      </para>

    </refsect2>

    <title>FILES</title>

    <para>
      The command has a state file located at
      <filename>@LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/watcher.data</filename>
      (only used on the master) and a log file at
      <filename>@LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/ganeti/watcher.log</filename>. Removal of
      either file will not affect correct operation; the removal of
      the state file will just cause the restart counters for the
      instances to reset to zero.
    </para>
