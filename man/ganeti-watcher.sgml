    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
      The <command>&dhpackage;</command> is a periodically run script
      which is responsible for keeping the instances in the correct
      status.
    </para>

    <para>
      Its primary function is to try to keep running all instances
      which are marked as <emphasis>up</emphasis> in the configuration
      file, by trying to start them a limited number of times.
    </para>

    <para>
      Its other function is to <quote>repair</quote> DRBD links by
      reactivating the block devices of instances which have
      secondaries on nodes that have been rebooted.
    </para>

    <para>
      The watcher does synchronous queries but will submit jobs for
      executing the changes. Due to locking, it could be that the jobs
      execute much later than the watcher executes them.
    </para>

    <para>
      The command has a state file located at
      <filename>@LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/watcher.data</filename> and a log
      file at
      <filename>@LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/ganeti/watcher.log</filename>. Removal of
      either file will not affect correct operation; the removal of
      the state file will just cause the restart counters for the
      instances to reset to zero.
    </para>
