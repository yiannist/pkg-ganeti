.SH NAME
ganeti-watcher \- ganeti cluster watcher
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBganeti-watcher \fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBganeti-watcher\fR is a periodically run script
which is responsible for keeping the instances in the correct
status.
.PP
Its primary function is to try to keep running all instances
which are marked as \fBup\fR in the configuration
file, by trying to start them a limited number of times.
.PP
Its other function is to ``repair'' DRBD links by
reactivating the block devices of instances which have
secondaries on nodes that have been rebooted.
.PP
In order to prevent piling up commands, all the
\fBgnt-*\fR commands executed by ganeti-watcher are
run with a timeout of 15 seconds.
.PP
The command has a state file located at
\fI@LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/ganeti/watcher.data\fR and a log
file at
\fI@LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/ganeti/watcher.log\fR\&. Removal of
either file will not affect correct operation; the removal of
the state file will just cause the restart counters for the
instances to reset to zero.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.PP
Report bugs to http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/ or contact the
