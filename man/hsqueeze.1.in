.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hsqueeze does dynamic power management, by powering up or shutting down
nodes, depending on the current load of the cluster.
Currently, only suggesting nodes is implemented.
.SS ALGORITHM
.PP
hsqueeze considers all online non-master nodes with only externally
mirrored instances as candidates for being taken offline.
These nodes are iteratively, starting from the node with the least
number of instances, added to the set of nodes to be put offline, if
possible.
A set of nodes is considered as suitable for being taken offline, if,
after marking these nodes as offline, balancing the cluster by the
algorithm used by \f[B]hbal\f[](1) yields a situation where all
instances are located on online nodes, and each node has at least the
target resources free for new instances.
.PP
All offline nodes with a tag starting with \f[C]htools:standby\f[] are
considered candidates for being taken online.
Those nodes are taken online till balancing the cluster by the algorithm
used by \f[B]hbal\f[](1) yields a situation where each node has at least
the minimal resources free for new instances.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -L [\f[I]path\f[]]
Backend specification: collect data directly from the master daemon,
which is to be contacted via LUXI (an internal Ganeti protocol).
The option is described in the man page \f[B]htools\f[](1).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -S \f[I]filename\f[], --save-cluster=\f[I]filename\f[]
If given, the state of the cluster before the squeezing is saved to the
given file plus the extension "original" (i.e.
\f[I]filename\f[].original), and the state at the end of the squeezing
operation is saved to the given file plus the extension "squeezed" (i.e.
\f[I]filename\f[].squeezed).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -C[\f[I]filename\f[]], --print-commands[=\f[I]filename\f[]]
If given, a shell script containing the commands to squeeze or unsqueeze
the cluster are saved in a file with the given name; if no name is
provided, they are printed to stdout.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -t \f[I]datafile\f[], --text-data=\f[I]datafile\f[]
Backend specification: the name of the file holding node and instance
information (if not collecting LUXI).
This or one of the other backends must be selected.
The option is described in the man page \f[B]htools\f[](1).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B --minimal-resources=\f[I]factor\f[]
Specify the amount of resources to be free on each node for hsqueeze not
to consider onlining additional nodes.
The value is reported a multiple of the standard instance specification,
as taken from the instance policy.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B --target-resources=\f[I]factor\f[]
Specify the amount of resources to remain free on any node after
squeezing.
The value is reported a multiple of the standard instance specification,
as taken from the instance policy.
