.PP
Adds the given node to the cluster.
.PP
This command is used to join a new node to the cluster. You will
have to provide the password for root of the node to be able to add
the node in the cluster. The command needs to be run on the Ganeti
master.
.PP
Note that the command is potentially destructive, as it will
forcibly join the specified host the cluster, not paying attention
to its current status (it could be already in a cluster, etc.)
.PP
The \f[B]-s\ (--secondary-ip)\f[] is used in dual-home clusters and
specifies the new node\[aq]s IP in the secondary network. See the
discussion in \f[B]gnt-cluster\f[](8) for more information.
.PP
In case you\[aq]re readding a node after hardware failure, you can
use the \f[B]--readd\f[] parameter. In this case, you don\[aq]t
need to pass the secondary IP again, it will reused from the
cluster. Also, the drained and offline flags of the node will be
cleared before re-adding it.
.PP
The \f[B]--force-join\f[] option is to proceed with adding a node
even if it already appears to belong to another cluster. This is
used during cluster merging, for example.
.PP
The \f[B]-g\ (--node-group)\f[] option is used to add the new node
into a specific node group, specified by UUID or name. If only one
node group exists you can skip this option, otherwise it\[aq]s
mandatory.
.PP
The \f[B]vm_capable\f[], \f[B]master_capable\f[],
\f[B]ndparams\f[], \f[B]diskstate\f[] and \f[B]hvstate\f[] options
are described in \f[B]ganeti\f[](7), and are used to set the
properties of the new node.
.PP
The command performs some operations that change the state of the
master and the new node, like copying certificates and starting the
node daemon on the new node, or updating \f[B]/etc/hosts\f[] on the
master node. If the command fails at a later stage, it doesn\[aq]t
undo such changes. This should not be a problem, as a successful
run of \f[B]gnt-node\ add\f[] will bring everything back in sync.
.PP
Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-node\ add\ node5.example.com
      #\ gnt-node\ add\ -s\ 192.0.2.5\ node5.example.com
      #\ gnt-node\ add\ -g\ group2\ -s\ 192.0.2.9\ node9.group2.example.com
\f[]
.SS ADD-TAGS
.PP
\f[B]add-tags\f[] [--from \f[I]file\f[]] {\f[I]nodename\f[]}
{\f[I]tag\f[]...}
.PP
Add tags to the given node. If any of the tags contains invalid
characters, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \f[B]--from\f[] option is given, the list of tags will be
extended with the contents of that file (each line becomes a tag).
In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the command line
(if you do, both sources will be used). A file name of - will be
interpreted as stdin.

 {\f[I]node\f[]}
.PP
This command will move instances away from the given node. If
\f[B]--primary-only\f[] is given, only primary instances are
evacuated, with \f[B]--secondary-only\f[] only secondaries. If
neither is given, all instances are evacuated. It works only for
instances having a drbd disk template.
.PP
The new location for the instances can be specified in two ways:
.IP \[bu] 2
as a single node for all instances, via the
\f[B]-n\ (--new-secondary)\f[] option
.IP \[bu] 2
or via the \f[B]-I\ (--iallocator)\f[] option, giving a script name
as parameter, so each instance will be in turn placed on the (per
the script) optimal node
.PP
The \f[B]--early-release\f[] changes the code so that the old
storage on node being evacuated is removed early (before the resync
is completed) and the internal Ganeti locks are also released for
both the current secondary and the new secondary, thus allowing
more parallelism in the cluster operation. This should be used only
when recovering from a disk failure on the current secondary (thus
the old storage is already broken) or when the storage on the
primary node is known to be fine (thus we won\[aq]t need the old
storage for potential recovery).
.PP
Note that this command is equivalent to using per-instance commands
for each affected instance individually:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]--primary-only\f[] is equivalent to
\f[B]gnt-instance\ failover/migration\f[] for non-DRBD instances,
but for DRBD instances it\[aq]s different, and usually is a slow
process (it will change the primary to another node while keeping
the secondary, this requiring data copies, whereas failover/migrate
will only toggle the primary/secondary roles, a fast process)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]--secondary-only\f[] is equivalent to
\f[B]gnt-instance\ replace-disks\f[] in the secondary node change
mode (only valid for DRBD instances)
.IP \[bu] 2
when neither of the above is done a combination of the two cases is
run
.PP
See \f[B]ganeti(7)\f[] for a description of \f[B]--submit\f[] and
other common options.

Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-node\ evacuate\ -I\ hail\ node3.example.com
\f[]
.SS FAILOVER
.PP
\f[B]failover\f[] [-f] [--ignore-consistency] {\f[I]node\f[]}
.PP
This command will fail over all instances having the given node as
primary to their secondary nodes. This works only for instances
having a drbd disk template.
.PP
Normally the failover will check the consistency of the disks
before failing over the instance. If you are trying to migrate
instances off a dead node, this will fail. Use the
\f[B]--ignore-consistency\f[] option for this purpose.
.PP
Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-node\ failover\ node1.example.com
\f[]
.SS INFO
.PP
\f[B]info\f[] [\f[I]node\f[]...]
.PP
Show detailed information about the nodes in the cluster. If you
don\[aq]t give any arguments, all nodes will be shows, otherwise
the output will be restricted to the given names.

The \f[B]--no-headers\f[] option will skip the initial header line.
The \f[B]--separator\f[] option takes an argument which denotes
what will be used between the output fields. Both these options are
to help scripting.
.PP
The units used to display the numeric values in the output varies,
depending on the options given. By default, the values will be
formatted in the most appropriate unit. If the \f[B]--separator\f[]
option is given, then the values are shown in mebibytes to allow
parsing by scripts. In both cases, the \f[B]--units\f[] option can
be used to enforce a given output unit.
.PP
Queries of nodes will be done in parallel with any running jobs.
This might give inconsistent results for the free disk/memory.
.PP
The \f[B]-v\f[] option activates verbose mode, which changes the
display of special field states (see \f[B]ganeti(7)\f[]).
.PP
The \f[B]-o\ (--output)\f[] option takes a comma-separated list of
output fields. The available fields and their meaning are:

.PP
If the value of the option starts with the character \f[B]+\f[],
the new fields will be added to the default list. This allows one
to quickly see the default list plus a few other fields, instead of
retyping the entire list of fields.
.PP
Note that some of these fields are known from the configuration of
the cluster (e.g. \f[B]name\f[], \f[B]pinst\f[], \f[B]sinst\f[],
\f[B]pip\f[], \f[B]sip\f[]) and thus the master does not need to
contact the node for this data (making the listing fast if only
fields from this set are selected), whereas the other fields are
"live" fields and require a query to the cluster nodes.
.PP
Depending on the virtualization type and implementation details,
the \f[B]mtotal\f[], \f[B]mnode\f[] and \f[B]mfree\f[] fields may
have slighly varying meanings. For example, some solutions share
the node memory with the pool of memory used for instances (KVM),
whereas others have separate memory for the node and for the
instances (Xen).
.PP
If exactly one argument is given and it appears to be a query
filter (see \f[B]ganeti(7)\f[]), the query result is filtered
accordingly. For ambiguous cases (e.g. a single field name as a
filter) the \f[B]--filter\f[] (\f[B]-F\f[]) option forces the
argument to be treated as a filter (e.g.
\f[B]gnt-node\ list\ -F\ master_candidate\f[]).
.PP
If no node names are given, then all nodes are queried. Otherwise,
only the given nodes will be listed.
.SS LIST-DRBD
.PP
\f[B]list-drbd\f[] [--no-headers] [--separator=\f[I]SEPARATOR\f[]]
node
.PP
Lists the mapping of DRBD minors for a given node. This outputs a
static list of fields (it doesn\[aq]t accept the \f[B]--output\f[]
option), as follows:
.TP
.B \f[B]Node\f[]
The (full) name of the node we are querying
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]Minor\f[]
The DRBD minor
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]Instance\f[]
The instance the DRBD minor belongs to
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]Disk\f[]
The disk index that the DRBD minor belongs to
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]Role\f[]
Either \f[B]primary\f[] or \f[B]secondary\f[], denoting the role of
the node for the instance (note: this is not the live status of the
DRBD device, but the configuration value)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]PeerNode\f[]
The node that the minor is connected to on the other end
.RS
.RE
.PP
This command can be used as a reverse lookup (from node and minor)
to a given instance, which can be useful when debugging DRBD
issues.
.PP
Note that this command queries Ganeti via
:manpage:`ganeti-confd(8)`, so it won\[aq]t be available if support
for \f[B]confd\f[] has not been enabled at build time; furthermore,
in Ganeti 2.6 this is only available via the Haskell version of
confd (again selected at build time).
.SS LIST-FIELDS
.PP
\f[B]list-fields\f[] [field...]
.PP

.SS LIST-TAGS

[--ignore-ipolicy]
[--submit] {\f[I]node\f[]}
.PP
This command will migrate all instances having the given node as
primary to their secondary nodes. This works only for instances
having a drbd disk template.
.PP
As for the \f[B]gnt-instance migrate\f[] command, the options
\f[B]--no-live\f[], \f[B]--migration-mode\f[] and
\f[B]--no-runtime-changes\f[] can be given to influence the
migration type.
.PP
If \f[B]--ignore-ipolicy\f[] is given any instance policy
violations occuring during this operation are ignored.
.PP
See \f[B]ganeti(7)\f[] for a description of \f[B]--submit\f[] and

This command changes the role of the node. Each options takes
either a literal yes or no, and only one option should be given as
yes. The meaning of the roles and flags are described in the
manpage \f[B]ganeti(7)\f[].
.PP
The option \f[B]--node-powered\f[] can be used to modify
state-of-record if it doesn\[aq]t reflect the reality anymore.
.PP
In case a node is demoted from the master candidate role, the
operation will be refused unless you pass the
\f[B]--auto-promote\f[] option. This option will cause the
operation to lock all cluster nodes (thus it will not be able to
run in parallel with most other jobs), but it allows automated
maintenance of the cluster candidate pool. If locking all cluster
node is too expensive, another option is to promote manually
another node to master candidate before demoting the current one.
.PP
Example (setting a node offline, which will demote it from master
candidate role if is in that role):
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-node\ modify\ --offline=yes\ node1.example.com
\f[]
.PP
The \f[B]-s\ (--secondary-ip)\f[] option can be used to change the
node\[aq]s secondary ip. No drbd instances can be running on the
node, while this operation is taking place.
.PP
See \f[B]ganeti(7)\f[] for a description of \f[B]--submit\f[] and
other common options.

\f[]
.SS REMOVE

\f[]
.SS REMOVE-TAGS

\f[B]remove-tags\f[] [--from \f[I]file\f[]] {\f[I]nodename\f[]}
{\f[I]tag\f[]...}
.PP
Remove tags from the given node. If any of the tags are not
existing on the node, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \f[B]--from\f[] option is given, the list of tags to be
removed will be extended with the contents of that file (each line
becomes a tag). In this case, there is not need to pass tags on the
command line (if you do, tags from both sources will be removed). A
file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.

.PP
Note that for the "file" type, the total disk space might not equal
to the sum of used and free, due to the method Ganeti uses to
compute each of them. The total and free values are computed as the
total and free space values for the filesystem to which the
directory belongs, but the used space is computed from the used
space under that directory \f[I]only\f[], which might not be
necessarily the root of the filesystem, and as such there could be
files outside the file storage directory using disk space and
causing a mismatch in the values.

Modifies storage volumes on a node. Only LVM physical volumes can
be modified at the moment. They have a storage type of "lvm-pv".

.PP
Repairs a storage volume on a node. Only LVM volume groups can be
repaired at this time. They have the storage type "lvm-vg".
.PP
On LVM volume groups, \f[B]repair-storage\f[] runs
\f[B]vgreduce\ --removemissing\f[].
.PP
\f[B]Caution:\f[] Running this command can lead to data loss. Use
it with care.
.PP
The \f[B]--ignore-consistency\f[] option will ignore any
inconsistent disks (on the nodes paired with this one). Use of this
option is most likely to lead to data-loss.
.PP
Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-node\ repair-storage\ node5.example.com\ lvm-vg\ xenvg

.SS POWERCYCLE
.PP
\f[B]powercycle\f[] [--yes] [--force] [--submit] {\f[I]node\f[]}
.PP
This command (tries to) forcefully reboot a node. It is a command
that can be used if the node environment is broken, such that the
admin can no longer login over SSH, but the Ganeti node daemon is
still working.
.PP
Note that this command is not guaranteed to work; it depends on the
hypervisor how effective is the reboot attempt. For Linux, this
command requires the kernel option \f[B]CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ\f[] to
be enabled.
.PP
The \f[B]--yes\f[] option can be used to skip confirmation, while
the \f[B]--force\f[] option is needed if the target node is the
master node.
.PP
See \f[B]ganeti(7)\f[] for a description of \f[B]--submit\f[] and
other common options.
.SS POWER
.PP
\f[B]power\f[] [\f[B]--force\f[]] [\f[B]--ignore-status\f[]]
[\f[B]--all\f[]] [\f[B]--power-delay\f[]] on|off|cycle|status
[\f[I]nodes\f[]]
.PP
This command calls out to out-of-band management to change the
power state of given node. With \f[B]status\f[] you get the power
status as reported by the out-of-band managment script.
.PP
Note that this command will only work if the out-of-band
functionality is configured and enabled on the cluster. If this is
not the case, please use the \f[B]powercycle\f[] command above.
.PP
Using \f[B]--force\f[] you skip the confirmation to do the
operation. Currently this only has effect on \f[B]off\f[] and
\f[B]cycle\f[].
On those two you can \f[I]not\f[] operate on the master. However,
the command will provide you with the command to invoke to operate
on the master nerver-mind. This is considered harmful and Ganeti
does not support the use of it.
.PP
Providing \f[B]--ignore-status\f[] will ignore the offline=N state
of a node and continue with power off.
.PP
\f[B]--power-delay\f[] specifies the time in seconds (factions
allowed) waited between powering on the next node. This is by
default 2 seconds but can increased if needed with this option.
.PP
\f[I]nodes\f[] are optional. If not provided it will call out for
every node in the cluster. Except for the \f[B]off\f[] and
\f[B]cycle\f[] command where you\[aq]ve to explicit use
\f[B]--all\f[] to select all.
.SS HEALTH
.PP
\f[B]health\f[] [\f[I]nodes\f[]]
.PP
This command calls out to out-of-band management to ask for the
health status of all or given nodes. The health contains the node
name and then the items element with their status in a
\f[B]item=status\f[] manner. Where \f[B]item\f[] is script specific
and \f[B]status\f[] can be one of \f[B]OK\f[], \f[B]WARNING\f[],
\f[B]CRITICAL\f[] or \f[B]UNKNOWN\f[].
Items with status \f[B]WARNING\f[] or \f[B]CRITICAL\f[] are logged
and annotated in the command line output.
