.SH NAME
gnt-node \- node administration
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgnt-node \fR \fBcommand\fR [ \fBarguments...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBgnt-node\fR is used for managing the
(physical) nodes in the ganeti system.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.SS "ADD"

\fBadd\fR [ \fB--readd\fR ] [ \fB-s \fIsecondary_ip\fB\fR ] \fB\fInodename\fB\fR

.PP
Adds the given node to the cluster.
.PP
This command is used to join a new node to the cluster. You
will have to provide the password for root of the node to be
able to add the node in the cluster. The command needs to be
run on the ganeti master.
.PP
Note that the command is potentially destructive, as it will
forcibly join the specified host the cluster, not paying
attention to its current status (it could be already in a
cluster, etc.)
.PP
The \fB-s\fR is used in dual-home clusters and
specifies the new node's IP in the secondary network. See the
discussion in \fBgnt-cluster\fR(8) for more
information.
.PP
In case you're readding a node after hardware failure, you can
use the \fB--readd\fR parameter. In this case, you
don't need to pass the secondary IP again, it will reused from
the cluster. Also, the drained and
offline flags of the node will be cleared
before re-adding it.
.PP
Example:

.nf
# gnt-node add node5.example.com
# gnt-node add -s 192.168.44.5 node5.example.com
        
.fi
.SS "ADD-TAGS"

\fBadd-tags\fR [ \fB--from \fIfile\fB\fR ] \fB\fInodename\fB\fR \fB\fItag\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.PP
Add tags to the given node. If any of the tags contains
invalid characters, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \fB--from\fR option is given, the list of
tags will be extended with the contents of that file (each
line becomes a tag). In this case, there is not need to pass
tags on the command line (if you do, both sources will be
used). A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.
.SS "EVACUATE"

\fBevacuate\fR [ \fB-f\fR ] [ \fB--early-release\fR ] [ \fB--iallocator \fINAME\fB\fR | \fB--new-secondary \fIdestination_node\fB\fR ] \fB\fInode\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.PP
This command will move all secondary instances away from the
given node(s). It works only for instances having a drbd disk
template.
.PP
The new location for the instances can be specified in two ways:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
as a single node for all instances, via the
\fB--new-secondary\fR option
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
or via the \fB--iallocator\fR option,
giving a script name as parameter, so each instance will
be in turn placed on the (per the script) optimal
node
.PP
The \fB--early-release\fR changes the code so that
the old storage on node being evacuated is removed early
(before the resync is completed) and the internal Ganeti locks
are also released for both the current secondary and the new
secondary, thus allowing more parallelism in the cluster
operation. This should be used only when recovering from a
disk failure on the current secondary (thus the old storage is
already broken) or when the storage on the primary node is
known to be fine (thus we won't need the old storage for
potential recovery).
.PP
Example:

.nf
          # gnt-node evacuate -I dumb node3.example.com
        
.fi
.SS "FAILOVER"

\fBfailover\fR [ \fB-f\fR ] [ \fB--ignore-consistency\fR ] \fB\fInode\fB\fR

.PP
This command will fail over all instances having the given
node as primary to their secondary nodes. This works only for
instances having a drbd disk template.
.PP
Normally the failover will check the consistency of the disks
before failing over the instance. If you are trying to migrate
instances off a dead node, this will fail. Use the
\fB--ignore-consistency\fR option for this purpose.
.PP
Example:

.nf
          # gnt-node failover node1.example.com
        
.fi
.SS "INFO"

\fBinfo\fR [ \fB\fInode\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.PP
Show detailed information about the nodes in the cluster. If you
don't give any arguments, all nodes will be shows, otherwise the
output will be restricted to the given names.
.SS "LIST"

\fBlist\fR [ \fB--sync\fR ]
    [ \fB--no-headers\fR ] [ \fB--separator=\fISEPARATOR\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB--units=\fIUNITS\fB\fR ] [ \fB-o \fI[+]FIELD,...\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB--roman\fR ]
    [ \fBnode\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.PP
Lists the nodes in the cluster.
.PP
The \fB--no-headers\fR option will skip the initial
header line. The \fB--separator\fR option takes an
argument which denotes what will be used between the output
fields. Both these options are to help scripting.
.PP
The units used to display the numeric values in the output
varies, depending on the options given. By default, the values
will be formatted in the most appropriate unit. If the
\fB--separator\fR option is given, then the values
are shown in mebibytes to allow parsing by scripts. In both
cases, the \fB--units\fR option can be used to
enforce a given output unit.
.PP
By default, the query of nodes will be done in parallel with
any running jobs. This might give inconsistent results for the
free disk/memory. The \fB--sync\fR can be used to
grab locks for all the nodes and ensure consistent view of the
cluster (but this might stall the query for a long time).
.PP
Passing the \fB--roman\fR option gnt-node list will try to
output some of its fields in a latin-friendly way. This is not the
default for backwards compatibility.
.PP
The \fB-o\fR option takes a comma-separated list of
output fields. The available fields and their meaning are:
.TP
\fBname\fR
the node name
.TP
\fBpinst_cnt\fR
the number of instances having this node as
primary
.TP
\fBpinst_list\fR
the list of instances having this node as
primary, comma separated
.TP
\fBsinst_cnt\fR
the number of instances having this node as a
secondary node
.TP
\fBsinst_list\fR
the list of instances having this node as a
secondary node, comma separated
.TP
\fBpip\fR
the primary ip of this node (used for cluster
communication)
.TP
\fBsip\fR
the secondary ip of this node (used for data
replication in dual-ip clusters, see \fBgnt-cluster\fR(8)
.TP
\fBdtotal\fR
total disk space in the volume group used for
instance disk allocations
.TP
\fBdfree\fR
available disk space in the volume group
.TP
\fBmtotal\fR
total memory on the physical node
.TP
\fBmnode\fR
the memory used by the node itself
.TP
\fBmfree\fR
memory available for instance
allocations
.TP
\fBbootid\fR
the node bootid value; this is a linux specific
feature that assigns a new UUID to the node at each boot
and can be use to detect node reboots (by tracking
changes in this value)
.TP
\fBtags\fR
comma-separated list of the node's
tags
.TP
\fBserial_no\fR
the so called 'serial number' of the node;
this is a numeric field that is incremented each time
the node is modified, and it can be used to detect
modifications
.TP
\fBctime\fR
the creation time of the node; note that this field
contains spaces and as such it's harder to parse

if this attribute is not present (e.g. when upgrading
from older versions), then "N/A" will be shown instead
.TP
\fBmtime\fR
the last modification time of the node; note that this
field contains spaces and as such it's harder to parse

if this attribute is not present (e.g. when upgrading
from older versions), then "N/A" will be shown instead
.TP
\fBuuid\fR
Show the UUID of the node (generated
automatically by Ganeti)
.TP
\fBctotal\fR
the toal number of logical processors
.TP
\fBcnodes\fR
the number of NUMA domains on the node, if the
hypervisor can export this information
.TP
\fBcsockets\fR
the number of physical CPU sockets, if the
hypervisor can export this information
.TP
\fBmaster_candidate\fR
whether the node is a master candidate or not
.TP
\fBdrained\fR
whether the node is drained or not; the cluster
still communicates with drained nodes but excludes them
from allocation operations
.TP
\fBoffline\fR
whether the node is offline or not; if offline,
the cluster does not communicate with offline nodes;
useful for nodes that are not reachable in order to
avoid delays
.TP
\fBrole\fR
A condensed version of the node flags; this field will
output a one-character field, with the following
possible values:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBM\fR for the master
node
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBC\fR for a master
candidate
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBR\fR for a regular
node
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBD\fR for a drained
node
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBO\fR for an offline
node
.RE
.PP
If the value of the option starts with the character
+, the new fields will be added to the
default list. This allows to quickly see the default list plus
a few other fields, instead of retyping the entire list of
fields.
.PP
Note that some of this fields are known from the configuration
of the cluster (e.g. name, pinst, sinst, pip, sip and thus the master does
not need to contact the node for this data (making the listing
fast if only fields from this set are selected), whereas the
other fields are "live" fields and we need to make a query to
the cluster nodes.
.PP
Depending on the virtualization type and implementation
details, the mtotal, mnode and mfree may have slighly varying
meanings. For example, some solutions share the node memory
with the pool of memory used for instances
(KVM), whereas others have separate memory
for the node and for the instances (Xen).
.PP
If no node names are given, then all nodes are
queried. Otherwise, only the given nodes will be listed.
.SS "LIST-TAGS"

\fBlist-tags\fR \fB\fInodename\fB\fR

.PP
List the tags of the given node.
.SS "MIGRATE"

\fBmigrate\fR [ \fB-f\fR ] [ \fB--non-live\fR ] \fB\fInode\fB\fR

.PP
This command will migrate all instances having the given
node as primary to their secondary nodes. This works only for
instances having a drbd disk template.
.PP
As for the \fBgnt-instance migrate\fR command,
the \fB--no-live\fR option can be given to do a
non-live migration.
.PP
Example:

.nf
          # gnt-node migrate node1.example.com
        
.fi
.SS "MODIFY"

\fBmodify\fR [ \fB-f\fR ] [ \fB--submit\fR ] [ \fB--master-candidate=yes|no\fR ] [ \fB--drained=yes|no\fR ] [ \fB--offline=yes|no\fR ] [ \fB--auto-promote\fR ] \fB\fInode\fB\fR

.PP
This command changes the role of the node. Each options takes
either a literal yes or
no, and only one option should be given as
yes\&. The meaning of the roles are described
in the manpage \fBganeti\fR(7)\&.
.PP
In case a node is demoted from the master candidate role, the
operation will be refused unless you pass
the \fB--auto-promote\fR option. This option will
cause the operation to lock all cluster nodes (thus it will
not be able to run in parallel with most other jobs), but it
allows automated maintenance of the cluster candidate pool. If
locking all cluster node is too expensive, another option is
to promote manually another node to master candidate before
demoting the current one.
.PP
Example (setting a node offline, which will demote it from
master candidate role if is in that role):

.nf
# gnt-node modify --offline=yes node1.example.com
        
.fi
.PP
Example (setting the node back to online and master candidate):

.nf
# gnt-node modify --offline=no --master-candidate=yes node1.example.com
        
.fi
.SS "REMOVE"

\fBremove\fR \fB\fInodename\fB\fR

.PP
Removes a node from the cluster. Instances must be removed or
migrated to another cluster before.
.PP
Example:

.nf
# gnt-node remove node5.example.com
        
.fi
.SS "REMOVE-TAGS"

\fBremove-tags\fR [ \fB--from \fIfile\fB\fR ] \fB\fInodename\fB\fR \fB\fItag\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.PP
Remove tags from the given node. If any of the tags are not
existing on the node, the entire operation will abort.
.PP
If the \fB--from\fR option is given, the list of
tags will be extended with the contents of that file (each
line becomes a tag). In this case, there is not need to pass
tags on the command line (if you do, both sources will be
used). A file name of - will be interpreted as stdin.
.SS "VOLUMES"

\fBvolumes\fR [ \fB--no-headers\fR ] [ \fB--human-readable\fR ] [ \fB--separator=\fISEPARATOR\fB\fR ] [ \fB--output=\fIFIELDS\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB\fInode\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.PP
Lists all logical volumes and their physical disks from the node(s)
provided.
.PP
The \fB--no-headers\fR option will skip the initial
header line. The \fB--separator\fR option takes an
argument which denotes what will be used between the output
fields. Both these options are to help scripting.
.PP
The units used to display the numeric values in the output
varies, depending on the options given. By default, the values
will be formatted in the most appropriate unit. If the
\fB--separator\fR option is given, then the values
are shown in mebibytes to allow parsing by scripts. In both
cases, the \fB--units\fR option can be used to
enforce a given output unit.
.PP
The \fB-o\fR option takes a comma-separated list of
output fields. The available fields and their meaning are:
.TP
\fBnode\fR
the node name on which the volume exists
.TP
\fBphys\fR
the physical drive (on which the LVM physical
volume lives)
.TP
\fBvg\fR
the volume group name
.TP
\fBname\fR
the logical volume name
.TP
\fBsize\fR
the logical volume size
.TP
\fBinstance\fR
The name of the instance to which this volume
belongs, or (in case it's an orphan volume) the
character ``-''
.PP
Example:

.nf
# gnt-node volumes node5.example.com
Node              PhysDev   VG    Name                                 Size Instance
node1.example.com /dev/hdc1 xenvg instance1.example.com-sda_11000.meta 128  instance1.example.com
node1.example.com /dev/hdc1 xenvg instance1.example.com-sda_11001.data 256  instance1.example.com
        
.fi
.SS "LIST-STORAGE"

\fBlist-storage\fR [ \fB--no-headers\fR ] [ \fB--human-readable\fR ] [ \fB--separator=\fISEPARATOR\fB\fR ] [ \fB--storage-type=\fISTORAGE_TYPE\fB\fR ] [ \fB--output=\fIFIELDS\fB\fR ]
    [ \fB\fInode\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.PP
Lists the available storage units and their details for the
given node(s).
.PP
The \fB--no-headers\fR option will skip the initial header
line. The \fB--separator\fR option takes an argument which
denotes what will be used between the output fields. Both these options
are to help scripting.
.PP
The units used to display the numeric values in the output varies,
depending on the options given. By default, the values will be
formatted in the most appropriate unit. If the
\fB--separator\fR option is given, then the values are shown
in mebibytes to allow parsing by scripts. In both cases, the
\fB--units\fR option can be used to enforce a given output
unit.
.PP
The \fB--storage-type\fR option can be used to choose a
storage unit type. Possible choices are lvm-pv,
lvm-vg or file\&.
.PP
The \fB-o\fR option takes a comma-separated list of
output fields. The available fields and their meaning are:
.TP
\fBnode\fR
the node name on which the volume exists
.TP
\fBtype\fR
the type of the storage unit (currently just
what is passed in via
\fB--storage-type\fR)
.TP
\fBname\fR
the path/identifier of the storage unit
.TP
\fBsize\fR
total size of the unit; for the file type see a note below
.TP
\fBused\fR
used space in the unit; for the file type see a note below
.TP
\fBfree\fR
available disk space
.TP
\fBallocatable\fR
whether we the unit is available for allocation
(only lvm-pv can change this
setting, the other types always report true)
.PP
Note that for the ``file'' type, the total disk
space might not equal to the sum of used and free, due to the
method Ganeti uses to compute each of them. The total and free
values are computed as the total and free space values for the
filesystem to which the directory belongs, but the used space
is computed from the used space under that directory
\fBonly\fR, which might not be necessarily the
root of the filesystem, and as such there could be files
outside the file storage directory using disk space and
causing a mismatch in the values.
.PP
Example:

.nf
node1# gnt-node list-storage node2
Node  Type   Name        Size Used   Free Allocatable
node2 lvm-pv /dev/sda7 673.8G 1.5G 672.3G Y
node2 lvm-pv /dev/sdb1 698.6G   0M 698.6G Y
        
.fi
.SS "MODIFY-STORAGE"

\fBmodify-storage\fR [ \fB--allocatable=yes|no\fR ]
    \fB\fInode\fB\fR \fB\fIstorage-type\fB\fR \fB\fIvolume-name\fB\fR

.PP
Modifies storage volumes on a node. Only LVM physical volumes
can be modified at the moment. They have a storage type
of ``lvm-pv''\&.
.PP
Example:

.nf
# gnt-node modify-storage --allocatable no node5.example.com lvm-pv /dev/sdb1
        
.fi
.SS "REPAIR-STORAGE"

\fBrepair-storage\fR [ \fB--ignore-consistency\fR ] \fB\fInode\fB\fR \fB\fIstorage-type\fB\fR \fB\fIvolume-name\fB\fR

.PP
Repairs a storage volume on a node. Only LVM volume groups can
be repaired at this time. They have the storage type
``lvm-vg''\&.
.PP
On LVM volume groups, \fBrepair-storage\fR runs
``vgreduce --removemissing''\&.
.sp
.RS
.B "Caution:"
Running this command can lead to data loss. Use it with care.
.RE
.PP
The \fB--ignore-consistency\fR option will ignore
any inconsistent disks (on the nodes paired with this
one). Use of this option is most likely to lead to data-loss.
.PP
Example:

.nf
# gnt-node repair-storage node5.example.com lvm-vg xenvg
        
.fi
.SS "POWERCYCLE"

\fBpowercycle\fR [ \fB--yes\fR ] [ \fB--force\fR ] \fB\fInode\fB\fR

.PP
This commands (tries to) forcefully reboot a node. It is a
command that can be used if the node environemnt is broken,
such that the admin can no longer login over ssh, but the
ganeti node daemon is still working.
.PP
Note that this command is not guaranteed to work; it depends
on the hypervisor how effective is the reboot attempt. For
Linux, this command require that the kernel option
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ is enabled.
.PP
The \fB--yes\fR option can be used to skip
confirmation, while the \fB--force\fR option is
needed if the target node is the master node.
