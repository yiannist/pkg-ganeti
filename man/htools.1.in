.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]htools\f[] is a suite of tools designed to help with
allocation/movement of instances and balancing of Ganeti clusters.
\f[B]htools\f[] is also the generic binary that must be symlinked
or hardlinked under each tool\[aq]s name in order to perform the
different functions. Alternatively, the environment variable HTOOLS
can be used to set the desired role.
.PP
Installed as \f[B]hbal\f[], it computes and optionally executes a
suite of instance moves in order to balance the cluster.
.PP
Installed as \f[B]hspace\f[], it computes how many additional
instances can be fit on a cluster, while maintaining N+1 status. It
can run on models of existing clusters or of simulated clusters.
.PP
Installed as \f[B]hail\f[], it acts as an IAllocator plugin, i.e.
it is used by Ganeti to compute new instance allocations and
instance moves.
.PP
Installed as \f[B]hscan\f[], it scans the local or remote cluster
state and saves it to files which can later be reused by the other
roles.
.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.PP
Options behave the same in all program modes, but not all program
modes support all options. Some common options are:
.TP
.B -p, --print-nodes
Prints the node status, in a format designed to allow the user to
understand the node\[aq]s most important parameters. If the command
in question makes a cluster transition (e.g. balancing or
allocation), then usually both the initial and final node status is
printed.
.RS
.PP
It is possible to customise the listed information by passing a
comma-separated list of field names to this option (the field list
is currently undocumented), or to extend the default field list by
prefixing the additional field list with a plus sign. By default,
the node list will contain the following information:
.TP
.B F
a character denoting the status of the node, with \[aq]-\[aq]
meaning an offline node, \[aq]*\[aq] meaning N+1 failure and blank
meaning a good node
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B Name
the node name
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B t_mem
the total node memory
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B n_mem
the memory used by the node itself
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B i_mem
the memory used by instances
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B x_mem
amount memory which seems to be in use but cannot be determined why
or by which instance; usually this means that the hypervisor has
some overhead or that there are other reporting errors
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B f_mem
the free node memory
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B r_mem
the reserved node memory, which is the amount of free memory needed
for N+1 compliance
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B t_dsk
total disk
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B f_dsk
free disk
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B pcpu
the number of physical cpus on the node
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B vcpu
the number of virtual cpus allocated to primary instances
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B pcnt
number of primary instances
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B scnt
number of secondary instances
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B p_fmem
percent of free memory
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B p_fdsk
percent of free disk
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B r_cpu
ratio of virtual to physical cpus
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B lCpu
the dynamic CPU load (if the information is available)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B lMem
the dynamic memory load (if the information is available)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B lDsk
the dynamic disk load (if the information is available)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B lNet
the dynamic net load (if the information is available)
.RS
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B -v, --verbose
Increase the output verbosity. Each usage of this option will
increase the verbosity (currently more than 2 doesn\[aq]t make
sense) from the default of one.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -q, --quiet
Decrease the output verbosity. Each usage of this option will
decrease the verbosity (less than zero doesn\[aq]t make sense) from
the default of one.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -V, --version
Just show the program version and exit.

.RE
.SS UNITS
.PP
Some options accept not simply numerical values, but numerical
values together with a unit. By default, such unit-accepting
options use mebibytes. Using the lower-case letters of \f[I]m\f[],
\f[I]g\f[] and \f[I]t\f[] (or their longer equivalents of
\f[I]mib\f[], \f[I]gib\f[], \f[I]tib\f[], for which case
doesn\[aq]t matter) explicit binary units can be selected. Units in
the SI system can be selected using the upper-case letters of
\f[I]M\f[], \f[I]G\f[] and \f[I]T\f[] (or their longer equivalents
of \f[I]MB\f[], \f[I]GB\f[], \f[I]TB\f[], for which case
doesn\[aq]t matter).
.PP
More details about the difference between the SI and binary systems
can be read in the \f[I]units(7)\f[] man page.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The environment variable \f[B]HTOOLS\f[] can be used instead of
renaming/symlinking the programs; simply set it to the desired role
and then the name of the program is no longer used.
.SH REPORTING BUGS
.PP
Report bugs to project website (http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/)

Ganeti mailing list (ganeti@googlegroups.com).
