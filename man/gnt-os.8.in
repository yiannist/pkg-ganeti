.SH NAME
gnt-os \- Instance operating system administration
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgnt-os \fR \fBcommand\fR [ \fBarguments...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBgnt-os\fR is used for managing the list
of available operating system flavours for the instances in the
Ganeti cluster.
.SH "COMMANDS"

\fBlist\fR

.PP
Gives the list of available/supported OS to use in the
instances. When creating the instance you can give the OS-name
as an option.
.PP
Note that hidden or blacklisted OSes are not displayed by this
command, use \fBdiagnose\fR for showing those.

\fBdiagnose\fR

.PP
This command will help you see why an installed OS is not
available in the cluster. The \fBlist\fR command
shows only the OS-es that the cluster sees available on all
nodes. It could be that some OS is missing from a node, or is
only partially installed, and this command will show the details
of all the OSes and the reasons they are or are not valid.

\fBinfo\fR

.PP
This command will list detailed information about each OS
available in the cluster, including its validity status, the
supported API versions, the supported parameters (if any) and
their documentations, etc.

\fBmodify\fR [ \fB-H \fIHYPERVISOR\fB [ : option=\fIvalue\fB\fI ...\fB ]\fR ] \fB\fIOS\fB\fR

.PP
This command will allow you to modify OS parameters.
.PP
To modify the per-OS hypervisor parameters (which override the
global hypervisor parameters), you can run modify
\fB-H\fR with the same syntax as in
\fBgnt-cluster init\fR to override default hypervisor
parameters of the cluster for specified
\fIOS\fR argument.
.PP
To modify the hidden and blacklisted states of an OS, pass the
options \fB--hidden \fIyes|no\fB\fR,
or respectively \fB--blacklisted ...\fR\&. The 'hidden'
state means that an OS won't be listed by default in the OS
list, but is available for installation. The 'blacklisted' state
means that the OS is not listed and is also not allowed for new
instance creations (but can be used for reinstalling old
instances).
.PP
Note: The \fIOS\fR doesn't have to exists.
This allows preseeding the settings for
\fIOS\fRes not yet known to
\fBgnt-os\fR\&.
