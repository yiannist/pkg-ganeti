.SH NAME
gnt-os \- instance operating system administration
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgnt-os \fR \fBcommand\fR [ \fBarguments...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBgnt-os\fR is used for managing the list
of available operating system flavours for the instances in the
ganeti cluster.
.SH "COMMANDS"

\fBlist\fR

.PP
Gives the list of available/supported OS to use in the
instances. When creating the instance you can give the OS-name
as an option.

\fBdiagnose\fR

.PP
This command will help you see why an installed OS is not
available in the cluster. The \fBlist\fR command
shows only the OS-es that the cluster sees available on all
nodes. It could be that some OS is missing from a node, or is
only partially installed, and this command will show the details
of all the OSes and the reasons they are or are not valid.
