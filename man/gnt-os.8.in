.SH Name
.PP
gnt-os - Instance operating system administration
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]gnt-os\f[] {command} [arguments...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]gnt-os\f[] is used for managing the list of available operating
system flavours for the instances in the Ganeti cluster.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS LIST
.PP
\f[B]list\f[] [--no-headers]
.PP
Gives the list of available/supported OS to use in the instances.
When creating the instance you can give the OS-name as an option.
.PP
Note that hidden or blacklisted OSes are not displayed by this command,
use \f[B]diagnose\f[] for showing those.
.SS DIAGNOSE
.PP
\f[B]diagnose\f[]
.PP
This command will help you see why an installed OS is not available in
the cluster.
The \f[B]list\f[] command shows only the OS-es that the cluster sees
available on all nodes.
It could be that some OS is missing from a node, or is only partially
installed, and this command will show the details of all the OSes and
the reasons they are or are not valid.
.SS INFO
.PP
\f[B]info\f[]
.PP
This command will list detailed information about each OS available in
the cluster, including its validity status, the supported API versions,
the supported parameters (if any) and their documentations, etc.
.SS MODIFY
.PP
\f[B]modify\f[] [--submit] [--print-job-id]

.PD 0
.P
.PD
{\f[I]OS\f[]}
.PP
This command will allow you to modify OS parameters.
.PP
To modify the per-OS hypervisor parameters (which override the global
hypervisor parameters), you can run modify \f[C]-H\f[] with the same
syntax as in \f[B]gnt-cluster init\f[] to override default hypervisor
parameters of the cluster for specified \f[I]OS\f[] argument.
.PP
To modify the hidden and blacklisted states of an OS, pass the options
\f[C]--hidden\f[]\f[I]yes|no\f[], or respectively
\f[C]--blacklisted\ ...\f[].
The \[aq]hidden\[aq] state means that an OS won\[aq]t be listed by
default in the OS list, but is available for installation.
The \[aq]blacklisted\[aq] state means that the OS is not listed and is
also not allowed for new instance creations (but can be used for
reinstalling old instances).
.PP
Note: The given operating system doesn\[aq]t have to exist.
This allows preseeding the settings for operating systems not yet known
to \f[B]gnt-os\f[].
.PP
See \f[B]ganeti\f[](7) for a description of \f[C]--submit\f[] and other
common options.
