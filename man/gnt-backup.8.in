gnt-backup - Ganeti instance import/export
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]gnt-backup\f[] {command} [arguments...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]gnt-backup\f[] is used for importing and exporting
instances and their configuration from a Ganeti system. It is
useful for backing up instances and also to migrate them between
clusters.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS EXPORT
.PP
\f[B]export\f[] {-n \f[I]node\f[]} [--shutdown-timeout=\f[I]N\f[]]
[--noshutdown] [--remove-instance] [--ignore-remove-failures]
{\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Exports an instance to the target node. All the instance data and
its configuration will be exported under the
\f[B]@CUSTOM_EXPORT_DIR@/\f[]\f[I]instance\f[] directory on the
target node.
.PP
The \f[B]--shutdown-timeout\f[] is used to specify how much time to
wait before forcing the shutdown (xm destroy in xen, killing the
kvm process, for kvm). By default two minutes are given to each
instance to stop.
.PP
The \f[B]--noshutdown\f[] option will create a snapshot disk of the
instance without shutting it down first. While this is faster and
involves no downtime, it cannot be guaranteed that the instance
data will be in a consistent state in the exported dump.
.PP
The \f[B]--remove\f[] option can be used to remove the instance
after it was exported. This is useful to make one last backup
before removing the instance.
.PP
The exit code of the command is 0 if all disks were backed up
successfully, 1 if no data was backed up or if the configuration
export failed, and 2 if just some of the disks failed to backup.
The exact details of the failures will be shown during the command
execution (and will be stored in the job log). It is recommended
that for any non-zero exit code, the backup is considered invalid,
and retried.

{\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Imports a new instance from an export residing on
\f[I]source-node\f[] in \f[I]source-dir\f[].
\f[I]instance\f[] must be in DNS and resolve to a IP in the same
network as the nodes in the cluster. If the source node and
directory are not passed, the last backup in the cluster is used,
as visible with the \f[B]list\f[] command.
.PP
The \f[B]disk\f[] option specifies the parameters for the disks of
the instance. The numbering of disks starts at zero. For each disk,
at least the size needs to be given, and optionally the access mode
(read-only or the default of read-write) and LVM volume group can
also be specified. The size is interpreted (when no unit is given)
in mebibytes. You can also use one of the suffixes m, g or t to
specificy the exact the units used; these suffixes map to
mebibytes, gibibytes and tebibytes.
.PP
Alternatively, a single-disk instance can be created via the
\f[B]-s\f[] option which takes a single argument, the size of the
disk. This is similar to the Ganeti 1.2 version (but will only
create one disk).
.PP
If no disk information is passed, the disk configuration saved at
export time will be used.
.PP
The minimum disk specification is therefore empty (export
information will be used), a single disk can be specified as
\f[B]--disk\ 0:size=20G\f[] (or \f[B]-s\ 20G\f[] when using the
\f[B]-s\f[] option), and a three-disk instance can be specified as
\f[B]--disk\ 0:size=20G\ --disk\ 1:size=4G\ --disk\ 2:size=100G\f[].
.PP
The NICs of the instances can be specified via the \f[B]--net\f[]
option. By default, the NIC configuration of the original
(exported) instance will be reused. Each NIC can take up to three
parameters (all optional):
.TP
.B mac
either a value or \f[B]generate\f[] to generate a new unique MAC,
or \f[B]auto\f[] to reuse the old MAC
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B ip
specifies the IP address assigned to the instance from the Ganeti
side (this is not necessarily what the instance will use, but what
the node expects the instance to use)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B mode
specifies the connection mode for this nic: \f[B]routed\f[] or
\f[B]bridged\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B link
in bridged mode specifies the bridge to attach this NIC to, in
routed mode it\[aq]s intended to differentiate between different
routing tables/instance groups (but the meaning is dependent on the
network script in use, see \f[B]gnt-cluster\f[](8) for more
details)
.RS
.RE
.PP
Of these \f[B]mode\f[] and \f[B]link\f[] are nic parameters, and
inherit their default at cluster level.
.PP
If no network is desired for the instance, you should create a
single empty NIC and delete it afterwards via
\f[B]gnt-instance modify --net delete\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]-B\f[] option specifies the backend parameters for the
instance. If no such parameters are specified, the values are
inherited from the export. Possible parameters are:
.TP
.B memory
the memory size of the instance; as usual, suffixes can be used to
denote the unit, otherwise the value is taken in mebibites
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B vcpus
the number of VCPUs to assign to the instance (if this value makes
sense for the hypervisor)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B auto_balance
whether the instance is considered in the N+1 cluster checks
(enough redundancy in the cluster to survive a node failure)
.RS
.RE
.PP
The \f[B]-t\f[] options specifies the disk layout type for the
instance. If not passed, the configuration of the original instance
is used. The available choices are:
.TP
.B diskless
This creates an instance with no disks. Its useful for testing only
(or other special cases).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B plain
Disk devices will be logical volumes.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B drbd
Disk devices will be drbd (version 8.x) on top of lvm volumes.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B file
Disk devices will be backed up by files, under the directory
\f[B]@RPL_FILE_STORAGE_DIR@\f[].
By default, each instance will get a directory (as its own name)
under this path, and each disk is stored as individual files in
this (instance-specific) directory.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The \f[B]--iallocator\f[] option specifies the instance allocator
plugin to use. If you pass in this option the allocator will select
nodes for this instance automatically, so you don\[aq]t need to
pass them with the \f[B]-n\f[] option. For more information please
refer to the instance allocator documentation.
.PP
The optional second value of the \f[B]--node\f[] is used for the
drbd template and specifies the remote node.
.PP
Since many of the parameters are by default read from the exported
instance information and used as such, the new instance will have
all parameters explicitly specified, the opposite of a newly added
instance which has most parameters specified via cluster defaults.
To change the import behaviour to recognize parameters whose saved
value matches the current cluster default and mark it as such
(default value), pass the \f[B]--identify-defaults\f[] option. This
will affect the hypervisor, backend and NIC parameters, both read
from the export file and passed in via the command line.
.PP
Example for identical instance import:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-backup\ import\ -n\ node1.example.com\ instance3.example.com
\f[]
.PP
Explicit configuration example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-backup\ import\ -t\ plain\ --disk\ 0:size=1G\ -B\ memory=512\ \\
      >\ -n\ node1.example.com\ \\
      >\ instance3.example.com
\f[]
.SS LIST
.PP
\f[B]list\f[] [--node=\f[I]NODE\f[]]
.PP
Lists the exports currently available in the default directory in
all the nodes of the current cluster, or optionally only a subset
of them specified using the \f[B]--node\f[] option (which can be
used multiple times)
.PP
Example:
.PP
\f[CR]
      #\ gnt-backup\ list\ --nodes\ node1\ --nodes\ node2
\f[]
.SS REMOVE
.PP
\f[B]remove\f[] {instance_name}
.PP
Removes the backup for the given instance name, if any. If the
backup was for a deleted instance, it is needed to pass the FQDN of
the instance, and not only the short hostname.
