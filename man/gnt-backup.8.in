.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]gnt-backup\f[] {command} [arguments...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]gnt-backup\f[] is used for importing and exporting instances
and their configuration from a Ganeti system.
It is useful for backing up instances and also to migrate them between
clusters.

{\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Exports an instance to the target node.
All the instance data and its configuration will be exported under the
\f[C]@CUSTOM_EXPORT_DIR@/$instance\f[] directory on the target node.
.PP
The \f[C]--shutdown-timeout\f[] is used to specify how much time to wait
before forcing the shutdown (xm destroy in xen, killing the kvm process,
for kvm).
By default two minutes are given to each instance to stop.
.PP
The \f[C]--noshutdown\f[] option will create a snapshot disk of the
instance without shutting it down first.
While this is faster and involves no downtime, it cannot be guaranteed
that the instance data will be in a consistent state in the exported
dump.
.PP
The \f[C]--remove\f[] option can be used to remove the instance after it
was exported.
This is useful to make one last backup before removing the instance.
.PP
The exit code of the command is 0 if all disks were backed up
successfully, 1 if no data was backed up or if the configuration export
failed, and 2 if just some of the disks failed to backup.
The exact details of the failures will be shown during the command
execution (and will be stored in the job log).
It is recommended that for any non-zero exit code, the backup is
considered invalid, and retried.
.PP
See \f[B]ganeti\f[](7) for a description of \f[C]--submit\f[] and other
common options.

{\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Imports a new instance from an export residing on \f[I]source-node\f[]
in \f[I]source-dir\f[].
\f[I]instance\f[] must be in DNS and resolve to a IP in the same network
as the nodes in the cluster.
If the source node and directory are not passed, the last backup in the
cluster is used, as visible with the \f[B]list\f[] command.
.PP
The \f[C]disk\f[] option specifies the parameters for the disks of the
instance.
The numbering of disks starts at zero.
For each disk, at least the size needs to be given, and optionally the
access mode (read-only or the default of read-write) and LVM volume
group can also be specified.
The size is interpreted (when no unit is given) in mebibytes.
You can also use one of the suffixes m, g or t to specificy the exact
the units used; these suffixes map to mebibytes, gibibytes and
tebibytes.
.PP
Alternatively, a single-disk instance can be created via the \f[C]-s\f[]
option which takes a single argument, the size of the disk.
This is similar to the Ganeti 1.2 version (but will only create one
disk).
.PP
If no disk information is passed, the disk configuration saved at export
time will be used.
.PP
The minimum disk specification is therefore empty (export information
will be used), a single disk can be specified as
\f[C]--disk\ 0:size=20G\f[] (or \f[C]-s\ 20G\f[] when using the
\f[C]-s\f[] option), and a three-disk instance can be specified as
\f[C]--disk\ 0:size=20G\ --disk\ 1:size=4G\ --disk\ 2:size=100G\f[].
.PP
The NICs of the instances can be specified via the \f[C]--net\f[]
option.
By default, the NIC configuration of the original (exported) instance
will be reused.
Each NIC can take up to three parameters (all optional):
.TP
.B mac
either a value or \f[C]generate\f[] to generate a new unique MAC, or
\f[C]auto\f[] to reuse the old MAC
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B ip
specifies the IP address assigned to the instance from the Ganeti side
(this is not necessarily what the instance will use, but what the node
expects the instance to use)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B mode
specifies the connection mode for this NIC: \f[C]routed\f[],
\f[C]bridged\f[] or \f[C]openvswitch\f[]
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B link
in bridged and openvswitch mode specifies the interface to attach this
NIC to, in routed mode it\[aq]s intended to differentiate between
different routing tables/instance groups (but the meaning is dependent
on the network script in use, see \f[B]gnt-cluster\f[](8) for more
details)
.RS
.RE
.PP
Of these \f[C]mode\f[] and \f[C]link\f[] are NIC parameters, and inherit
their default at cluster level.
.PP
If no network is desired for the instance, you should create a single
empty NIC and delete it afterwards via \f[B]gnt-instance modify --net
delete\f[].
.PP
The \f[C]-B\f[] option specifies the backend parameters for the
instance.
If no such parameters are specified, the values are inherited from the
export.
Possible parameters are:
.TP
.B maxmem
the maximum memory size of the instance; as usual, suffixes can be used
to denote the unit, otherwise the value is taken in mebibytes
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B minmem
the minimum memory size of the instance; as usual, suffixes can be used
to denote the unit, otherwise the value is taken in mebibytes
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B vcpus
the number of VCPUs to assign to the instance (if this value makes sense
for the hypervisor)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B auto_balance
whether the instance is considered in the N+1 cluster checks (enough
redundancy in the cluster to survive a node failure)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B always_failover
\f[C]True\f[] or \f[C]False\f[], whether the instance must be failed
over (shut down and rebooted) always or it may be migrated (briefly
suspended)
.RS
.RE
.PP
The \f[C]-t\f[] options specifies the disk layout type for the instance.
If not passed, the configuration of the original instance is used.
The available choices are:
.TP
.B diskless
This creates an instance with no disks.
Its useful for testing only (or other special cases).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B plain
Disk devices will be logical volumes.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B drbd
Disk devices will be drbd (version 8.x) on top of lvm volumes.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B file
Disk devices will be backed up by files, under the cluster\[aq]s default
file storage directory.
By default, each instance will get a directory (as its own name) under
this path, and each disk is stored as individual files in this
(instance-specific) directory.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The \f[C]--iallocator\f[] option specifies the instance allocator plugin
to use.
If you pass in this option the allocator will select nodes for this
instance automatically, so you don\[aq]t need to pass them with the
\f[C]-n\f[] option.
For more information please refer to the instance allocator
documentation.
.PP
The optional second value of the \f[C]--node\f[] is used for the drbd
template and specifies the remote node.
.PP
The \f[C]--src-dir\f[] option allows importing instances from a
directory below \f[C]@CUSTOM_EXPORT_DIR@\f[].
.PP
If \f[C]--ignore-ipolicy\f[] is given any instance policy violations
occuring during this operation are ignored.
.PP
Since many of the parameters are by default read from the exported
instance information and used as such, the new instance will have all
parameters explicitly specified, the opposite of a newly added instance
which has most parameters specified via cluster defaults.
To change the import behaviour to recognize parameters whose saved value
matches the current cluster default and mark it as such (default value),
pass the \f[C]--identify-defaults\f[] option.
This will affect the hypervisor, backend and NIC parameters, both read
from the export file and passed in via the command line.
.PP
See \f[B]ganeti\f[](7) for a description of \f[C]--submit\f[] and other
common options.

Example for identical instance import:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ gnt-backup\ import\ -n\ node1.example.com\ instance3.example.com
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Explicit configuration example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ gnt-backup\ import\ -t\ plain\ --disk\ 0:size=1G\ -B\ memory=512\ \\
>\ -n\ node1.example.com\ \\
>\ instance3.example.com
\f[]
.fi
.SS LIST
.PP

[--separator=\f[I]SEPARATOR\f[]]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
[-o \f[I][+]FIELD,...\f[]]
.PP
Lists the exports currently available in the default directory in all
the nodes of the current cluster, or optionally only a subset of them
specified using the \f[C]--node\f[] option (which can be used multiple
times)
.PP
The \f[C]--no-headers\f[] option will skip the initial header line.
The \f[C]--separator\f[] option takes an argument which denotes what
will be used between the output fields.
Both these options are to help scripting.
.PP
The \f[C]-o\f[] option takes a comma-separated list of output fields.
The available fields and their meaning are:
.TP
.B \f[C]export\f[]
Export name
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]node\f[]
Node name
.RS
.RE
.PP
If the value of the option starts with the character \f[C]+\f[], the new
fields will be added to the default list.
This allows one to quickly see the default list plus a few other fields,
instead of retyping the entire list of fields.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ gnt-backup\ list\ --node\ node1\ --node\ node2
\f[]
.fi
.SS LIST-FIELDS
.PP
\f[B]list-fields\f[] [field...]
.PP
Lists available fields for exports.
.SS REMOVE
.PP
\f[B]remove\f[] {instance_name}
.PP
Removes the backup for the given instance name, if any.
If the backup was for a deleted instance, it is needed to pass the FQDN
of the instance, and not only the short hostname.
