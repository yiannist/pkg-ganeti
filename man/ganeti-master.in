.SH NAME
ganeti-master \- ganeti master startup script
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBganeti-master \fR [ \fB-d\fR ] { \fBstart\fR | \fBstop\fR }

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBganeti-master\fR is the program that activates
the cluster IP on the master node.
.PP
The script will first check to see if the IP is not already
alive on the cluster (on another node). If so, it wil abort the
startup.
.PP
If the master IP is unreachable, the script will add the IP to
the master_netdev interface (as configured at
cluster init time) with the label the name of the interface plus
``:0'', so that the new IP shows up as a
subinterface. After that, it will send three gratuitous ARP
updates so that the switch updates its tables immediatly
(instead of after expiry).
.SH "EXIT CODES"
.TP
\fB0\fR
successfull exit, IP activated
.TP
