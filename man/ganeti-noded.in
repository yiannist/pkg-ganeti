.SH NAME
ganeti-noded \- ganeti daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBganeti-noded \fR [ \fB-f\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBganeti-noded\fR is the daemon which is
responsible for the cluster functions in the ganeti system.
.PP
For testing purposes, you can give the \fB-f\fR
option and the program won't detach from the running terminal.
.SS "ROLE"
.PP
The role of the node daemon is to do almost all the actions
that change the state of the node. Things like creating disks
for instances, activating disks, starting/stopping instance
and so on are done via the node daemon.
.PP
If the node daemon is stopped, the instances are not affected,
but the master won't be able to talk to that node.
.SS "COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL"
.PP
Currently the master-node protocol is done using the Twisted
perspective broker libraries.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.PP
Report bugs to http://code.google.com/p/ganeti/ or contact the
