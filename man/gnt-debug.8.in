gnt-debug - Debug commands
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]gnt-debug\f[] {command} [arguments...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]gnt-debug\f[] is used for debugging the Ganeti system.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS IALLOCATOR
.PP
\f[B]iallocator\f[] [--debug] [--dir \f[I]DIRECTION\f[]] {--algorithm
\f[I]ALLOCATOR\f[] } [--mode \f[I]MODE\f[]] [--mem \f[I]MEMORY\f[]]
[--disks \f[I]DISKS\f[]] [--disk-template \f[I]TEMPLATE\f[]] [--nics
\f[I]NICS\f[]] [--os-type \f[I]OS\f[]] [--vcpus \f[I]VCPUS\f[]] [--tags
\f[I]TAGS\f[]] {\f[I]instance\f[]}
.PP
Executes a test run of the \f[I]iallocator\f[] framework.
.PP
The command will build input for a given iallocator script (named with
the \f[C]--algorithm\f[] option), and either show this input data (if
\f[I]DIRECTION\f[] is \f[C]in\f[]) or run the iallocator script and show
its output (if \f[I]DIRECTION\f[] is \f[C]out\f[]).
.PP
If the \f[I]MODE\f[] is \f[C]allocate\f[], then an instance definition
is built from the other arguments and sent to the script, otherwise
(\f[I]MODE\f[] is \f[C]relocate\f[]) an existing instance name must be
passed as the first argument.
.PP
This build of Ganeti will look for iallocator scripts in the following
directories: @CUSTOM_IALLOCATOR_SEARCH_PATH@; for more details about
this framework, see the HTML or PDF documentation.
.SS DELAY
.PP
\f[B]delay\f[] [--debug] [--no-master] [--interruptible] [-n
\f[I]NODE\f[]...] {\f[I]duration\f[]}
.PP
Run a test opcode (a sleep) on the master and on selected nodes (via an
RPC call).
This serves no other purpose but to execute a test operation.
.PP
The \f[C]-n\f[] option can be given multiple times to select the nodes
for the RPC call.
By default, the delay will also be executed on the master, unless the
\f[C]--no-master\f[] option is passed.
.PP
The \f[C]--interruptible\f[] option allows a running delay opcode to be
interrupted by communicating with a special domain socket.
If any data is sent to the socket, the delay opcode terminates.
If this option is used, no RPCs are performed, but locks are still
acquired.
.PP
The \f[I]delay\f[] argument will be interpreted as a floating point
number.
.SS SUBMIT-JOB
.PP
\f[B]submit-job\f[] [--verbose] [--timing-stats] [--job-repeat
\f[I]N\f[]] [--op-repeat \f[I]N\f[]] [--each] {opcodes_file...}
.PP
This command builds a list of opcodes from files in JSON format and
submits a job per file to the master daemon.
It can be used to test options that are not available via command line.
.PP
The \f[C]verbose\f[] option will additionally display the corresponding
job IDs and the progress in waiting for the jobs; the
\f[C]timing-stats\f[] option will show some overall statistics inluding
the number of total opcodes, jobs submitted and time spent in each stage
(submit, exec, total).
.PP
The \f[C]job-repeat\f[] and \f[C]op-repeat\f[] options allow to submit
multiple copies of the passed arguments; job-repeat will cause N copies
of each job (input file) to be submitted (equivalent to passing the
arguments N times) while op-repeat will cause N copies of each of the
opcodes in the file to be executed (equivalent to each file containing N
copies of the opcodes).
.PP
The \f[C]each\f[] option allow to submit each job separately (using
\f[C]N\f[] SubmitJob LUXI requests instead of one SubmitManyJobs
request).
.SS TEST-JOBQUEUE
.PP
\f[B]test-jobqueue\f[]
.PP
Executes a few tests on the job queue.
This command might generate failed jobs deliberately.
.SS LOCKS
.PP
\f[B]locks\f[] [--no-headers] [--separator=\f[I]SEPARATOR\f[]] [-v]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
[-o \f[I][+]FIELD,...\f[]] [--interval=\f[I]SECONDS\f[]]
.PP
Shows a list of locks in the master daemon.
.PP
The \f[C]--no-headers\f[] option will skip the initial header line.
The \f[C]--separator\f[] option takes an argument which denotes what
will be used between the output fields.
Both these options are to help scripting.
.PP
The \f[C]-v\f[] option activates verbose mode, which changes the display
of special field states (see \f[B]ganeti\f[](7)).
.PP
The \f[C]-o\f[] option takes a comma-separated list of output fields.
The available fields and their meaning are:
.TP
.B \f[C]mode\f[]
Mode in which the lock is currently acquired (exclusive or shared)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]name\f[]
Lock name
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]owner\f[]
Current lock owner(s)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]pending\f[]
Threads waiting for the lock
.RS
.RE
.PP
If the value of the option starts with the character \f[C]+\f[], the new
fields will be added to the default list.
This allows one to quickly see the default list plus a few other fields,
instead of retyping the entire list of fields.
.PP
Use \f[C]--interval\f[] to repeat the listing.
A delay specified by the option value in seconds is inserted.
.SS WCONFD
.PP
\f[B]wconfd\f[] echo \f[I]text\f[]
.PP
Tests the WConf daemon by invoking its \f[C]echo\f[] function.
.PP
A given text is sent to WConfd through RPC, echoed back by WConfd and
printed to the console.
.PP
\f[B]wconfd\f[] listlocks \f[I]jid\f[]
.PP
A request to list the locks owned by the given job id is sent to WConfd
and the answer is displayed.
.PP
\f[B]wconfd\f[] listalllocks
.PP
A request to list all locks in use, directly or indirectly, is sent to
WConfd and the answer is displayed.
.PP
\f[B]wconfd\f[] listalllocks
.PP
A request to list all locks in use, directly or indirectly, together
with their respective direct owners is sent to WConfd and the answer is
displayed.
.PP
\f[B]wconfd\f[] flushconfig
.PP
A request to ensure that the configuration is fully distributed to the
master candidates.
