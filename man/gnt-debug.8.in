.SH NAME
gnt-debug \- debug commands
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgnt-debug \fR \fBcommand\fR [ \fBarguments...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBgnt-debug\fR is used for debugging the
ganeti system.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.SS "ALLOCATOR"

\fBallocator\fR [ \fB--debug\fR ] [ \fB--dir \fIDIRECTION\fB\fR ] \fB--algorithm \fIALLOCATOR\fB
\fR [ \fB--mode \fIMODE\fB\fR ] [ \fB--mem \fIMEMORY\fB\fR ] [ \fB--disks \fIDISKS\fB\fR ] [ \fB--disk-template \fITEMPLATE\fB\fR ] [ \fB--nics \fINICS\fB\fR ] [ \fB--os-type \fIOS\fB\fR ] [ \fB--vcpus \fIVCPUS\fB\fR ] [ \fB--tags \fITAGS\fB\fR ] \fB\fIinstance\fB\fR

.PP
Executes a test run of the \fBiallocator\fR framework.
.PP
The command will build input for a given iallocator script
(named with the \fB--algorithm\fR option), and
either show this input data (if
\fIDIRECTION\fR is
\fBin\fR) or run the iallocator script and show
its output (if \fIDIRECTION\fR is
\fBout\fR).
.PP
If the \fIMODE\fR is
\fBallocate\fR, then an instance definition is
built from the other arguments and sent to the script,
otherwise (\fIMODE\fR is
\fBrelocate\fR) an existing instance name must
be passed as the first argument.
.PP
This build of ganeti will look for iallocator scripts in the
following directories: \fI@CUSTOM_IALLOCATOR_SEARCH_PATH@\fR;
for more details about this framework, see the HTML or PDF
documentation.
.SS "DELAY"

\fBdelay\fR [ \fB--debug\fR ] [ \fB--no-master\fR ] [ \fB-n \fINODE\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ] \fB\fIduration\fB\fR

.PP
Run a test opcode (a sleep) on the master (internally in the
command) and on selected nodes (via an RPC call). This server
no other purpose but to execute a test operation.
.PP
The \fB-n\fR option can be given multiple times to
select the nodes for the RPC call. By default, the delay will
also be executed on the master, unless the
\fB--no-master\fR option is passed.
.PP
The \fIdelay\fR argument will be
interpreted as a floating point number.
.SS "SUBMIT-JOB"

\fBsubmit-job\fR [ \fB--verbose\fR ] [ \fB--timing-stats\fR ] [ \fB--job-repeat N\fR ] [ \fB--op-repeat N\fR ] \fBopcodes_file\fR\fI ...\fR

.PP
This command builds a list of opcodes from JSON-format files
and submits for each file a job to the master daemon. It can
be used to test some options that are not available via the
command line.
.PP
The \fBverbose\fR option will job the job IDs of
the submitted jobs and the progress in waiting for the jobs;
the \fBtiming-stats\fR option will show some
overall statistics with the number of total opcodes and jobs
submitted, and time time for each stage (submit, exec, total).
.PP
The \fBjob-repeat\fR and \fBop-repeat\fR
options allow to submit multiple copies of the passed
arguments; the job repeat will cause N copies of each job
(input file) to be submitted (equivalent to passing the
arguments N times) while the op repeat will cause each job to
contain multiple copies of the opcodes (equivalent to each
file containing N copies of the opcodes).
