.TH "GANETI-NODED" "8" "01 July 2010" "ganeti 2.0" ""

.SH NAME
ganeti-noded \- ganeti node daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBganeti-noded \fR [ \fB-f\fR ] [ \fB-d\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBganeti-noded\fR is the daemon which is
responsible for the node functions in the ganeti system.
.PP
By default, in order to be able to support features such as node
powercycling even on systems with a very damaged root disk, ganeti-noded
mlocks itself in ram. You can disable this feature by passing in the
\fB--no-mlock\fR\&.
.PP
For testing purposes, you can give the \fB-f\fR
option and the program won't detach from the running terminal.
.PP
Debug-level message can be activated by giving the
\fB-d\fR option.
.PP
Logging to syslog, rather than its own log file, can be enabled by
passing in the \fB--syslog\fR option.
.PP
The ganeti-noded daemon listens to port 1811 TCP, on all interfaces, by
default. This can be overridden by an entry in /etc/services or by
passing the \fB-p\fR option. The \fB-b\fR option
can be used to specify the address to bind to (defaults to 0.0.0.0).
.PP
Ganeti noded communication is protected via SSL, with a key generated at
cluster init time. This can be disabled with the
\fB--no-ssl\fR option, or a different ssl key and certificate
can be specified using the \fB-K\fR and \fB-C\fR
options.
.SS "ROLE"
.PP
The role of the node daemon is to do almost all the actions
that change the state of the node. Things like creating disks
for instances, activating disks, starting/stopping instance
and so on are done via the node daemon.
.PP
Also, in some cases the startup/shutdown of the master daemon
are done via the node daemon, and the cluster IP address is
also added/removed to the master node via it.
.PP
If the node daemon is stopped, the instances are not affected,
but the master won't be able to talk to that node.
.SS "COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL"
.PP
Currently the master-node RPC is done using a simple json-RPC
over HTTP(S).
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
