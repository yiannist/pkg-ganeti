.SH NAME
ganeti-noded \- ganeti node daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBganeti-noded \fR [ \fB-f\fR ] [ \fB-d\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBganeti-noded\fR is the daemon which is
responsible for the node functions in the ganeti system.
.PP
For testing purposes, you can give the \fB-f\fR
option and the program won't detach from the running terminal.
.PP
Debug-level message can be activated by giving the
\fB-d\fR option.
.SS "ROLE"
.PP
The role of the node daemon is to do almost all the actions
that change the state of the node. Things like creating disks
for instances, activating disks, starting/stopping instance
and so on are done via the node daemon.
.PP
Also, in some cases the startup/shutdown of the master daemon
are done via the node daemon, and the cluster IP address is
also added/removed to the master node via it.
.PP
If the node daemon is stopped, the instances are not affected,
but the master won't be able to talk to that node.
.SS "COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL"
.PP
Currently the master-node RPC is done using a simple json-RPC
over HTTP(S).
