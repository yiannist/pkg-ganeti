ganeti-noded - Ganeti node daemon
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]ganeti-noded\f[] [-f] [-d] [-p \f[I]PORT\f[]] [-b \f[I]ADDRESS\f[]]
[-i \f[I]INTERFACE\f[]] [--no-mlock] [--syslog] [--no-ssl] [-K
\f[I]SSL_KEY_FILE\f[]] [-C \f[I]SSL_CERT_FILE\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]ganeti-noded\f[] is the daemon which is responsible for the
node functions in the Ganeti system.
.PP
By default, in order to be able to support features such as node
powercycling even on systems with a very damaged root disk,
\f[B]ganeti-noded\f[] locks itself in RAM using \f[B]mlockall\f[](2).
You can disable this feature by passing in the \f[C]--no-mlock\f[] to
the daemon.
.PP
For testing purposes, you can give the \f[C]-f\f[] option and the
program won\[aq]t detach from the running terminal.
.PP
Debug-level message can be activated by giving the \f[C]-d\f[] option.
.PP
Logging to syslog, rather than its own log file, can be enabled by
passing in the \f[C]--syslog\f[] option.
.PP
The \f[B]ganeti-noded\f[] daemon listens to port 1811 TCP, on all
interfaces, by default.
The port can be overridden by an entry in the services database (usually
\f[C]/etc/services\f[]) or by passing the \f[C]-p\f[] option.
The \f[C]-b\f[] option can be used to specify the address to bind to
(defaults to \f[C]0.0.0.0\f[]); alternatively, the \f[C]-i\f[] option
can be used to specify the interface to bind do.
.PP
Ganeti noded communication is protected via SSL, with a key generated at
cluster init time.
This can be disabled with the \f[C]--no-ssl\f[] option, or a different
SSL key and certificate can be specified using the \f[C]-K\f[] and
\f[C]-C\f[] options.
.SS ROLE
.PP
The role of the node daemon is to do almost all the actions that change
the state of the node.
Things like creating disks for instances, activating disks,
starting/stopping instance and so on are done via the node daemon.
.PP
Also, in some cases the startup/shutdown of the master daemon are done
via the node daemon, and the cluster IP address is also added/removed to
the master node via it.
.PP
If the node daemon is stopped, the instances are not affected, but the
master won\[aq]t be able to talk to that node.
.SS COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
.PP
Currently the master-node RPC is done using a simple RPC protocol built
using JSON over HTTP(S).
.SH REPORTING BUGS
.PP
