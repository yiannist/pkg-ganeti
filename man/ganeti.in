.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The ganeti software manages physical nodes and virtual instances
of a cluster based on a virtualization software. The current
version (1.2) supports Xen 3.0 (also tested with 3.1).
.SH "QUICK START"
.PP
First you must install the software on all the cluster nodes,
either from sources or (if available) from a package. The next
step is to create the initial cluster configuration, using
gnt-cluster init\&.
.PP
Then you can add other nodes, or start creating instances.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
