ganeti-confd - Ganeti conf daemon
.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]ganeti-confd\f[] [-f] [-d]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]ganeti-confd\f[] is a daemon used to answer queries related to
the configuration of a Ganeti cluster.
.PP
For testing purposes, you can give the \f[B]-f\f[] option and the
program won\[aq]t detach from the running terminal.
.PP
Debug-level message can be activated by giving the \f[B]-d\f[]
option.
.SS ROLE
.PP
The role of the conf daemon is to make sure we have a highly
available and very fast way to query cluster configuration values.
This daemon is automatically active on all master candidates, and
so has no single point of failure. It communicates via UDP so each
query can easily be sent to multiple servers, and it answers
queries from a cached copy of the config it keeps in memory, so no
disk access is required to get an answer.
.PP
The config is reloaded from disk automatically when it changes,
with a rate limit of once per second.
.PP
If the conf daemon is stopped on all nodes, its clients won\[aq]t
be able to get query answers.
.SS COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
.PP
The confd protocol is an HMAC authenticated json-encoded custom
format, over UDP. A client library is provided to make it easy to
write software to query confd. More information can be found in the
Ganeti 2.1 design doc, and an example usage can be seen in the
(external) NBMA daemon for Ganeti.
