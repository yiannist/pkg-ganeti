Version 1.2.1
  - experimental HWM support, read the install document, section
    "Initializing the cluster"
  - allow for the PVM hypervisor per-instance kernel and initrd paths
  - add a new command ‘gnt-cluster verify-disks’ which uses a new
    algorithm to improve the reconnection of the DRBD pairs if the
    device on the secondary node has gone away
  - make logical volume code auto-activate LVs at disk activation time
  - slightly improve the speed of activating disks
  - allow specification of the MAC address at instance creation time,
    and changing it later via ‘gnt-instance modify’
  - fix handling of external commands that generate lots of output on
    stderr
  - update documentation with regard to minimum version of DRBD8
    supported

Version 1.2.0
  - Log the ‘xm create’ output to the node daemon log on failure (to
    help diagnosing the error)
  - In debug mode, log all external commands output if failed to the
    logs
  - Change parsing of lvm commands to ignore stderr

Version 1.2b3
  - Another round of updates to the DRBD 8 code to deal with more
    failures in the replace secondary node operation
  - Some more logging of failures in disk operations (lvm, drbd)
  - A few documentation updates
  - QA updates

Version 1.2b2
  - Change configuration file format from Python's Pickle to JSON.
    Upgrading is possible using the cfgupgrade utility.
  - Add support for DRBD 8.0 (new disk template `drbd`) which allows for
    faster replace disks and is more stable (DRBD 8 has many
    improvements compared to DRBD 0.7)
  - Added command line tags support (see man pages for gnt-instance,
    gnt-node, gnt-cluster)
  - Added instance rename support
  - Added multi-instance startup/shutdown
  - Added cluster rename support
  - Added `gnt-node evacuate` to simplify some node operations
  - Added instance reboot operation that can speedup reboot as compared
    to stop and start
  - Soften the requirement that hostnames are in FQDN format
  - The ganeti-watcher now activates drbd pairs after secondary node
    reboots
  - Removed dependency on debian's patched fping that uses the
    non-standard -S option
  - Now the OS definitions are searched for in multiple, configurable
    paths (easier for distros to package)
  - Some changes to the hooks infrastructure (especially the new
    post-configuration update hook)
  - Other small bugfixes
