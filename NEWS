Version 1.2.7
  - Change the default reboot type in gnt-instance reboot to "hard"
  - Reuse the old instance mac address by default on instance import,
    if the instance name is the same.
  - Handle situations in which the node info rpc returns incomplete results
    (issue 46)
  - Add checks for tcp/udp ports collisions in gnt-cluster verify
  - Improved version of batcher:
    - state file support
    - instance mac address support
    - support for HVM clusters/instances
  - Add an option to show the number of cpu sockets and nodes in gnt-node list
  - Support OSes that handle more than one version of the OS api
    (but do not change the current API in any other way)
  - Fix gnt-node migrate
  - gnt-debug man page
  - Fixes various more typos&small issues
  - Increase disk resync maximum speed to 60MB/s (from 30MB/s)

Version 1.2.6
  - new --hvm-nic-type and --hvm-disk-type flags to control the type of disk
    exported to fully virtualized instances.
  - provide access to the serial console of HVM instances
  - instance auto_balance flag, set by default. If turned off it will avoid
    warnings on cluster verify if there is not enough memory to fail over an
    instance. in the future it will prevent automatically failing it over when
    we will support that.
  - batcher tool for instance creation, see /tools/README.batcher
  - gnt-instance reinstall --select-os to interactively select a new operating
    system when reinstalling an instance.
  - when changing the memory amount on instance modify a check has been added
    that the instance will be able to start. also warnings are emitted if the
    instance will not be able to fail over, if auto_balance is true.
  - documentation fixes
  - sync fields between instance list/modify/add/import
  - fix a race condition in drbd when the sync speed was set after giving the
    device a remote peer.

Version 1.2.5
  - note: the allowed size and number of tags per object were reduced
  - fix a bug in “gnt-cluster verify” with inconsistent volume groups
  - fixed twisted 8.x compatibility
  - fixed gnt-instance replace-disks with iallocator
  - add TCP keepalives on twisted connections to detect restarted nodes
  - disk increase support, see “gnt-instance grow-disk”
  - implement bulk node/instance query for RAPI
  - add tags in node/instance listing (optional)
  - experimental migration (and live migration) support, read the man
    page for “gnt-instance migrate”
  - the ganeti-watcher logs are now timestamped, and the watcher also
    has some small improvements in handling its state file

Version 1.2.4
  - Experimental readonly, REST-based remote API implementation; automatically
    started on master node, TCP port 5080, if enabled by --enable-rapi
    parameter to configure script.
  - Instance allocator support. Add and import instance accept a --iallocator
    parameter, and call that instance allocator to decide which node to use for
    the instance. The iallocator document describes what's expected from an
    allocator script.
  - gnt-cluster verify N+1 memory redundancy checks: Unless passed the
    --no-nplus1-mem option gnt-cluster verify now checks that if a node is lost
    there is still enough memory to fail over the instances that reside on it.
  - gnt-cluster verify hooks: it is now possible to add post-hooks to
    gnt-cluster verify, to check for site-specific compliance. All the hooks
    will run, and their output, if any, will be displayed. Any failing hook
    will make the verification return an error value.
  - gnt-cluster verify now checks that its peers are reachable on the primary
    and secondary interfaces
  - gnt-node add now supports the --readd option, to readd a node that is still
    declared as part of the cluster and has failed.
  - gnt-* list commands now accept a new -o +field way of specifying output
    fields, that just adds the chosen fields to the default ones.
  - gnt-backup now has a new "remove" command to delete an existing export from
    the filesystem.
  - New per-instance parameters hvm_acpi, hvm_pae and hvm_cdrom_image_path have
    been added. Using them you can enable/disable acpi and pae support, and
    specify a path for a cd image to be exported to the instance. These
    parameters as the name suggest only work on HVM clusters.
  - When upgrading an HVM cluster to Ganeti 1.2.4, the values for ACPI and PAE
    support will be set to the previously hardcoded values, but the (previously
    hardcoded) path to the CDROM ISO image will be unset and if required, needs
    to be set manually with gnt-instance modify after the upgrade..
  - The address to which an instance's VNC console is bound is now selectable
    per-instance, rather than being cluster wide. Of course this only applies
    to instances controlled via VNC, so currently just applies to HVM clusters.

Version 1.2.3
  - more tweaks to the disk activation code (especially helpful for DRBD)
  - change the default ‘gnt-instance list’ output format, now there is
    one combined status field (see the manpage for the exact values this
    field will have)
  - some more fixes for the mac export to hooks change
  - make Ganeti not break with DRBD 8.2.x (which changed the version
    format in /proc/drbd) (issue 24)
  - add an upgrade tool from ‘remote_raid1’ disk template to ‘drbd’ disk
    template, allowing migration from DRBD0.7+MD to DRBD8

Version 1.2.2
  - fix ‘gnt-instance modify’ breakage introduced in 1.2.1 with the HVM
    support (issue 23)
  - add command aliases infrastructure and a few aliases
  - allow listing of VCPUs in the gnt-instance list and improve the man
    pages and the --help option of gnt-node/gnt-instance list
  - fix gnt-backup list with down nodes (issue 21)
  - change the tools location (move from $pkgdatadir to
    $pkglibdir/tools)
  - fix the dist archive and add a check for including svn/git files in
    the future
  - some developer-related changes: improve the burnin and the QA
    suite, add an upload script for testing during development

Version 1.2.1
  - experimental HVM support, read the install document, section
    "Initializing the cluster"
  - allow for the PVM hypervisor per-instance kernel and initrd paths
  - add a new command ‘gnt-cluster verify-disks’ which uses a new
    algorithm to improve the reconnection of the DRBD pairs if the
    device on the secondary node has gone away
  - make logical volume code auto-activate LVs at disk activation time
  - slightly improve the speed of activating disks
  - allow specification of the MAC address at instance creation time,
    and changing it later via ‘gnt-instance modify’
  - fix handling of external commands that generate lots of output on
    stderr
  - update documentation with regard to minimum version of DRBD8
    supported

Version 1.2.0
  - Log the ‘xm create’ output to the node daemon log on failure (to
    help diagnosing the error)
  - In debug mode, log all external commands output if failed to the
    logs
  - Change parsing of lvm commands to ignore stderr

Version 1.2b3
  - Another round of updates to the DRBD 8 code to deal with more
    failures in the replace secondary node operation
  - Some more logging of failures in disk operations (lvm, drbd)
  - A few documentation updates
  - QA updates

Version 1.2b2
  - Change configuration file format from Python's Pickle to JSON.
    Upgrading is possible using the cfgupgrade utility.
  - Add support for DRBD 8.0 (new disk template `drbd`) which allows for
    faster replace disks and is more stable (DRBD 8 has many
    improvements compared to DRBD 0.7)
  - Added command line tags support (see man pages for gnt-instance,
    gnt-node, gnt-cluster)
  - Added instance rename support
  - Added multi-instance startup/shutdown
  - Added cluster rename support
  - Added `gnt-node evacuate` to simplify some node operations
  - Added instance reboot operation that can speedup reboot as compared
    to stop and start
  - Soften the requirement that hostnames are in FQDN format
  - The ganeti-watcher now activates drbd pairs after secondary node
    reboots
  - Removed dependency on debian's patched fping that uses the
    non-standard -S option
  - Now the OS definitions are searched for in multiple, configurable
    paths (easier for distros to package)
  - Some changes to the hooks infrastructure (especially the new
    post-configuration update hook)
  - Other small bugfixes
